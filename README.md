NIME-bibliography
=================

This is the bibliography files (in BibTeX format) of all publications from the annual [International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression](http://www.nime.org) (NIME). These files are the source for the [NIME proceedings database](http://www.nime.org/archives/). 

The abstracts and keywords have been scraped from the each of the original PDF files using [this script](https://github.com/olovholm/NIME). We have been doing some automatic and manual cleaning up after running the script, but there are still linguistic (and other) errors in the database. Please help us clean it up!

The idea is that keeping the bibliography in an open and accessible format, it can be usable for the community, and it will also be easier to correct errors. 

Merge 
--------

All the individual BibTeX files can be merged into one large file using the following terminal command: 

    cat nime20* > nime.bib

This file is then read by the  WordPress plugin [WP-Publications](http://www.monperrus.net/martin/wp-publications), which is based on [bibtexbrowser](http://www.monperrus.net/martin/bibtexbrowser/).

NIME-bibliography
=================

This is the bibliography files (in BibTeX format) of all publications from the annual [International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression](http://www.nime.org) (NIME). These files are the source for the NIME proceedings database.

The idea is that keeping the bibliography in an open and accessible format, it can be usable for the community, and it will also be easier to correct errors.

authors discuss an innovative approach towardsthe conception, development and implementation of dynamicand responsive audio scenography : a constantly evolving,multi-layered sound design generated by continuous inputfrom a series of distributed wireless sensors deployed bothon the body of a performer and placed within the physicalstage environment. The paper is divided into conceptualand technological parts. We first describe the project's dramaturgical and conceptual context in order to situate theartistic framework that has guided the technological systemdesign. Specifically, this framework discusses the team's approach in combining techniques from situated computing,theatrical sound design practice and dynamical systems inorder to create a new kind of adaptive audio scenographicenvironment augmented by wireless, distributed sensing foruse in live theatrical performance. The goal of this adaptive sound design is to move beyond both existing playbackmodels used in theatre sound as well as the purely humancentered, controller-instrument approach used in much current interactive performance practice.},

It is based on a complex physical model of the vibrating plate - the source of sound in the majority of percussion instruments. A Xilinx Virtex II pro FPGA core handles the sound synthesis computations with an 8 billion operations per second performance and has been designed in such a way to allow a high level of control and flexibility. Strategies are also presented to that allow the parametric space of the model to be mapped to the playing gestures of the percussionist. },

A framewise chroma distribution over an entire musical piece is a useful and straightforward representation of its musical pitch over time.

Such an embedding is a representation or map of the different pitched energies in a song, and how these energies relate to each other in the context of the song. The paper presents an interactive version of this representation as an exploratory analytical tool or instrument for granular synthesis. Pointing and clicking on the interactive map recreates the acoustical energy present in the chroma blocks at that location, providing an effective way of both exploring the relationships between sounds in the original piece, and recreating a synthesized approximation of these sounds in an instrumental fashion. },

Mimi is a performer-centric tool designed for use in performance and teaching. Its key andnovel component is its visual interface, designed to providethe performer with instantaneous and continuous information on the state of the system. For human improvisation,in which context and planning are paramount, the relevantstate of the system extends to the near future and recentpast. Mimi's visual interface allows for a peculiar blendof raw reflex typically associated with improvisation, andpreparation and timing more closely affiliated with scorebased reading. Mimi is not only an effective improvisationpartner, it has also proven itself to be an invaluable platformthrough which to interrogate the mental models necessaryfor successful improvisation.},

We argue that this model not only excludes some contemporary aesthetic values but also limits the communicative ability of new music interfaces. As an alternative, an ecology of musical creation accounts for both a diversity of aesthetic goals and the complex interrelation of human and non-human agents. An ecological perspective on several approaches to musical creation with interactive technologies reveals an expanded, more inclusive view of artistic interaction that facilitates novel, compelling ways to use technology for music. This paper is fundamentally a call to consider the role of aesthetic values in the analysis of artistic processes and technologies. },

Techniques for accomplishing such mappings and enabling feature-based synthesis to be performed in real time are discussed.

We explore several options for characterizing improvisation at a higher level, and managing decisions for interactive performance in a rich timbral environment. We developed a simple, efficient framework using a small number of features suggested by recent work in mood modeling in music. We describe and evaluate the first version of the IMC, which was used in performance at the Live Algorithms for Music (LAM) conference in December 2006. We touch on developments on the system since LAM, and discuss future plans to address perceived shortcomings in responsiveness, and the ability of the system to make long-term adaptations. },

In this paper we propose a system that automatically generates original background music in real-time called VR-RoBoser. As a test case we present the application of VR-RoBoser to a dynamic avatar that explores its environment. We show that the musical events are directly and continuously generated and influenced by the behavior of the avatar in three-dimensional virtual space, generating a context dependent sonification. },

year = {2007},
abstract = {This paper reports on a survey conducted in the autumn of 2006 with the objective to understand people's relationship to their musical tools. The survey focused on the question of embodiment and its different modalities in the fields of acoustic and digital instruments. The questions of control, instrumental entropy, limitations and creativity were addressed in relation to people's activities of playing, creating or modifying their instruments. The approach used in the survey was phenomenological, i.e. we were concerned with the experience of playing, composing for and designing digital or acoustic instruments. At the time of analysis, we had 209 replies from musicians, composers, engineers, designers, artists and others interested in this topic. The survey was mainly aimed at instrumentalists and people who create their own instruments or compositions in flexible audio programming environments such as SuperCollider, Pure Data, ChucK, Max/MSP, CSound, etc. },

year = {2007},
abstract = {Playing music over the Internet, whether for real-time jamming, network performance or distance education, is constrained by the speed of light which introduces, over long distances, time delays unsuitable for musical applications. Current musical collaboration systems generally transmit compressed audio streams over low-latency and high-bandwidthnetworks to optimize musician synchronization. This paperproposes an alternative approach based on pattern recognition and music prediction. Trained for a particular typeof music, here the Indian tabla drum, the system calledTablaNet identifies rhythmic patterns by recognizing individual strokes played by a musician and mapping them dynamically to known musical constructs. Symbols representing these musical structures are sent over the network toa corresponding computer system. The computer at thereceiving end anticipates incoming events by analyzing previous phrases and synthesizes an estimated audio output.Although such a system may introduce variants due to prediction approximations, resulting in a slightly different musical experience at both ends, we find that it demonstratesa high level of playability with an immediacy not present inother systems, and functions well as an educational tool.},

The techniques for rendering acoustic events on multi-speaker or headphone-based surround systems have evolved considerably, making it possible to use them in real-time performances on light equipment. Controlling the placement of sound sources is usually done in idiosyncratic ways and has not yet been fully explored and formalized. This issue is addressed here with the proposition of a methodical approach. The mapping of gestures to source motion is implemented by giving the sources physical object properties and manipulating these characteristics with standard geometrical transforms through hierarchical or emergent relationships. },

year = {2007},
abstract = { WISEAR (Wireless Sensor Array)8, provides a robust andscalable platform for virtually limitless types of data input tosoftware synthesis engines. It is essentially a Linux based SBC(Single Board Computer) with 802.11a/b/g wireless capability.The device, with batteries, only weighs a few pounds and can beworn by a dancer or other live performer. Past work has focusedon connecting "conventional" sensors (eg., bend sensors,accelerometers, FSRs, etc...) to the board and using it as a datarelay, sending the data as real time control messages to synthesisengines like Max/MSP and RTcmix1. Current research hasextended the abilities of the device to take real-time audio andvideo data from USB cameras and audio devices, as well asrunning synthesis engines on board the device itself. Given itsgeneric network ability (eg., being an 802.11a/b/g device) there istheoretically no limit to the number of WISEAR boxes that canbe used simultaneously in a performance, facilitating multiperformer compositions. This paper will present the basic design philosophy behindWISEAR, explain some of the basic concepts and methods, aswell as provide a live demonstration of the running device, wornby the ,

The focus is on sound processing techniques which contain a high number of control parameters,and which exhibit subtle and interesting micro-variationsand textural qualities when controlled properly. The examples all use a simple low-dimensional controller - a standardgraphics tablet - and the task of initimate and subtle textural manipulations is left to the design of proper mappings,created using a custom toolbox of mapping functions. Thiswork further acts to contextualize past theoretical results bythe given musical presentations, and arrives at some conclusions about the interplay between musical intention, controlstrategies and the process of their design.},

year = {2007},
abstract = {This paper describes the design and implementation of a new interface prototype for live music mixing. The ColorDex system employs a completely new operational metaphor which allows the mix DJ to prepare up to six tracks at once, and perform mixes between up to three of those at a time. The basic premises of the design are: 1) Build a performance tool that multiplies the possible choices a DJ has in respect in how and when tracks are prepared and mixed; 2) Design the system in such a way that the tool does not overload the performer with unnecessary complexity, and 3) Make use of novel technology to make the performance of live music mixing more engaging for both the performer and the audience. The core components of the system are: A software program to load, visualize and playback digitally encoded tracks; the HDDJ device (built chiefly out of a repurposed hard disk drive), which provides tactile manipulation of the playback speed and position of tracks; and the Cubic Crossfader, a wireless sensor cube that controls of the volume of individual tracks, and allows the DJ to mix these in interesting ways. },

year = {2009},
abstract = {This paper introduces the new audiovisual sequencing system "Versum" that allows users to compose in three dimensions. In the present paper the conceptual soil from which this system has sprung is discussed first. Secondly, the basic concepts with which Versum operates are explained, providing a general idea of what is meant by sequencing in three dimensions and explaining what compositions made in Versum can look and sound like. Thirdly, the practical ways in which a composer can use Versum to make his own audiovisual compositions are presented by means of a more detailed description of the different graphical user interface elements. Fourthly, a short description is given of the modular structure of the software underlying Versum. Finally, several foresights regarding the directions in which Versum will continue to develop in the near future are presented. },

By programming feedback controllers to emulate the laws of physics, many haptic musical instruments have been previously designed thatmimic real acoustic musical instruments.

We presenta novel method for constructing haptic musical instrumentsin which a haptic device is directly interfaced with a conventional digital waveguide model by way of a junction element, improving the quality of the musician's interactionwith the virtual instrument.

abstract = {Haptic technology, providing force cues and creating a programmable physical instrument interface, can assist musicians in making gestures. The finite reaction time of thehuman motor control system implies that the execution of abrief musical gesture does not rely on immediate feedbackfrom the senses, rather it is preprogrammed to some degree.Consequently, we suggest designing relatively simple anddeterministic interfaces for providing haptic assistance.In this paper, we consider the specific problem of assisting a musician in selecting pitches from a continuous range.We build on a prior study by O'Modhrain of the accuracyof pitches selected by musicians on a Theremin-like hapticinterface. To improve the assistance, we augment the interface with programmed detents so that the musician can feelthe locations of equal tempered pitches. Nevertheless, themusician can still perform arbitrary pitch inflections such asglissandi, falls, and scoops. We investigate various formsof haptic detents, including fixed detent levels and forcesensitive detent levels. Preliminary results from a subjecttest confirm improved accuracy in pitch selection broughtabout by detents.},

The system consists of multiple Nintendo DS clients with an intuitive, user-configurable interface and a server computer which plays drum sounds. The Drummer Machine, a small piece of hardware to augment the performance of the Drummer, is also introduced. },

The primary goal of this study was to determine how players' actions changed when moving from an acoustic instrument like the tom drum, to a gestural controller like the Buchla Lightning, which bears little resemblance to an acoustic percussion instrument. Motion capture data was analyzed by comparing a subject's hand height variability and timing accuracy across the four instruments as they performed simple musical tasks. Results suggest that certain gestures such as hand height amplitude can be adapted to these gestural controllers with little change and that in general subjects' timing variability is significantly affected when playing on the Lightning and Radio Baton when compared to the more familiar tom drum and VDrum. Possible explanations and other observations are also presented. },

title = {Scratch-Off : A Gesture Based Mobile Music Game with Tactile Feedback},
year = {2009},
abstract = {This paper presents "Scratch-Off", a new musical multiplayer DJ game that has been designed for a mobile phone. We describe how the game is used as a test platform for experimenting with various types of multimodal feedback. The game uses movement gestures made by the players to scratch a record and control crossfades between tracks, with the objective of the game to make the correct scratch at the correct time in relation to the music. Gestures are detected using the devices built-in tri-axis accelerometer and multi-touch screen display. The players receive visual, audio and various types of vibrotactile feedback to help them make the correct scratch on the beat of the music track. We also discuss the results of a pilot study using this interface. },

The controller, MusicGrip, can capture the subtle dynamics of the user's grip while writing or drawing and map this to musical control signals and sonic outputs. This paper discusses this conversion of the common motor motion of handwriting into an innovative form of music expression. The presented example instrument can be used to integrate the composing aspect of music with painting and writing, creating a new art form from the resultant aural and visual representation of the collaborative performing process. },

The system which we propose contains both a gesture controller and robots at the same time. In this system, the Data Suit, BodySuit controls the avatar in Second Life and Second Life controls the exoskeleton, Powered Suit in real time. These are related with each other in conjunction with Second Life in Internet. BodySuit doesn't contain a hand-held controller. A performer, for example a dancer, wears a suit. Gestures are transformed into electronic signals by sensors. Powered Suit is another suit that a dancer wears, but gestures are generated by motors. This is a sort of wearable robot. Second Life is software that is developed by Linden Lab. It allows creating a virtual world and a virtual human (avatar) in Internet. Working together with BodySuit, Powered Suit, and Second Life the idea behind the system is that a human body is augmented by electronic signals and is reflected in a virtual world in order to be able to perform interactively. },

year = {2009},
abstract = {The carillon is one of the few instruments that elicit sophisticated haptic interaction from amateur and professional players alike. Like the piano keyboard, the velocity of a player's impact on each carillon key, or baton, affects the quality of the resultant tone; unlike the piano, each carillon baton returns a different forcefeedback. Force-feedback varies widely from one baton to the next across the entire range of the instrument and with further idiosyncratic variation from one instrument to another. This makes the carillon an ideal candidate for haptic simulation. The application of synthesized forcefeedback based on an analysis of forces operating in a typical carillon mechanism offers a blueprint for the design of an electronic practice clavier and with it the solution to a problem that has vexed carillonists for centuries, namely the inability to rehearse repertoire in private. This paper will focus on design and implementation of a haptic carillon clavier derived from an analysis of the Australian National Carillon in Canberra. },

year = {2009},
abstract = {In this paper we describe an approach for introducing newelectronic percussive sound possibilities for stringinstruments by "listening" to the sounds of the instrument'sbody and extracting audio and data from the wood'sacoustic vibrations. A method for capturing, localizing andanalyzing the percussive hits on the instrument's body ispresented, in connection with an audio-driven electronicpercussive sound module. The system introduces a newgesture-sound relationship in the electric string instrumentplaying environment, namely the use of percussivetechniques on the instrument's body which are null inregular circumstances due to selective and exclusivemicrophone use for the strings. Instrument bodypercussions are widely used in the acoustic instrumentalpraxis. They yield a strong potential for providing anextended soundscape via instrument augmentation, directlycontrolled by the musician through haptic manipulation ofthe instrument itself. The research work was carried out onthe electric guitar, but the method used can apply to anystring instrument with a resonating body.},

A performer can compose music by controlling varying cell patterns and sounds with visual and auditory fun. A performer assigns the elements of tone to two-dimensional cell patterns in the matrix of the Game of Life. Our system searches defined cell patterns in the varying matrix dynamically. If the patterns are matched, corresponding tones are generated. A performer can make cells in the matrix by moving in front of a camera and interactively influencing the generation of music. The progress of the Game of Life is controlled with a clock defined by the performer to configure the groove of the music. By running multiple matrices with different pattern mapping, clock timing, and instruments, we can perform an ensemble. The Life Game Orchestra is a fusion system of the design of a performer and the emergence of cellular automata as a complex system. },

A game server stores a representation of the state of a game, validates proposed moves by players, updates game state, and extracts a graph of piece-to-piece relationships. It also loads a plugin code module that acts as a composition. A plugin maps pieces and relationships on the board, such as support or attack relationships, to a timed sequence of notes and accents. The server transmits notes in a sequence to an audio renderer process via network datagrams. Two players can perform a composition by playing chess, and a player can improvise by adjusting a plugin's music mapping parameters via a graphical user interface. A composer can create a new composition by writing a new plugin that uses a distinct algorithm for mapping game rules and states to music. A composer can also write a new note-to-sound mapping program in the audio renderer language. This software is available at http://faculty.kutztown.edu/parson/music/ParsonMusic.html. },

This paper presents an evaluation of several force renderings for target acquisition in space when used to support a music related task. The study presented here addresses only one musical aspect: the need to repeat elements accurately in time and in content. Several force scenarios will be rendered over a simple 3D target acquisition task and users' performance will be quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. The results show how the users' subjective preference for a particular kind of force support does not always correlate to a quantitative measurement of performance enhancement. We describe a way in which a control mapping for a musical interface could be achieved without contradicting the users' preferences as obtained from the study. },

Gesturetrajectories are displayed in real time and can be comparedto the corresponding diagram shown in a textbook. In addition, since a conductor normally does not look at a screenwhile conducting, tones are played to represent a certainbeat in a conducting gesture. Further, the system can be controlled entirely with the baton, removing the need to switchfrom baton to mouse. The interface is intended to be usedfor pedagogy purposes.},

year = {2009},
abstract = {Music composition on computer is a challenging task, involving a range of data types to be managed within a single software tool. A composition typically comprises a complex arrangement of material, with many internal relationships between data in different locations repetition, inversion, retrograde, reversal and more sophisticated transformations. The creation of such complex artefacts is labour intensive, and current systems typically place a significant cognitive burden on the composer in terms of maintaining a work as a coherent whole. FrameWorks 3D is an attempt to improve support for composition tasks within a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) style environment via a novel three-dimensional (3D) user-interface. In addition to the standard paradigm of tracks, regions and tape recording analogy, FrameWorks displays hierarchical and transformational information in a single, fully navigable workspace. The implementation combines Java with Max/MSP to create a cross-platform, user-extensible package and will be used to assess the viability of such a tool and to develop the ideas further. },

title = {Anthropomorphic Musical Performance Robots at Waseda University : Increasing Understanding of the Nature of Human Musical Interaction Abstract},
year = {2009},
abstract = {During several decades, the research at Waseda University has been focused on developing anthropomorphic robots capable performing musical instruments. As a result of our research efforts, the Waseda Flutist Robot WF-4RIV and the Waseda Saxophonist Robot WAS-1 have been designed to reproduce the human player performance. As a long-term goal, we are proposing to enable the interaction between musical performance robots as well as with human players. In general the communication of humans within a band is a special case of conventional human social behavior. Rhythm, harmony and timbre of the music played represent the emotional states of the musicians. So the development of an artificial entity that participates in such an interaction may contribute to the better understanding of some of the mechanisms that enable the communication of humans in musical terms. Therefore, we are not considering a musical performance robot (MPR) just as a mere sophisticated MIDI instrument. Instead, its human-like design and the integration of perceptual capabilities may enable to act on its own autonomous initiative based on models which consider its own physical constrains. In this paper, we present an overview of our research approaches towards enabling the interaction between musical performance robots as well as with musicians. },

The central goal is to make the microcontroller an extension of theprogramming environment on the host computer in a manner that feels natural in that programming environment. Itwas designed to be open and flexible so that any programming environment can support it, and simple to implementboth on the microcontroller and the host computer to ensurea wide range of implementations. The current reference implementation is a library for Arduino/Wiring and is includedwith Arduino software package since version 0012.

It aims at giving instrumental music performers an extended control over the sound of their instrument byextending the understanding of the sound body from the instrument only to the combination of the instrument and thewhole body of the performer. The development started atARTeM and got the benefit of a three month numediartresearch project [1] that focused on three axes of research:pre-processing of sensor data, gesture recognition and mapping through interpolation. The objectives were the development of computing methods and flexible Max/MSP externals to be later integrated in the ARTeM software framework for the concerts with viola player Dominica Eyckmans. They could be used in a variety of other artistic worksand will be made available on the numediart website [1],where more detailed information can be found in the Quarterly Progress Scientific Report #4.},

In this way, Ocarina is also a type of social instrument that enables a different, perhaps even magical, sense of global connectivity. },

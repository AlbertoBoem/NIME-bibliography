year = {2005},
abstract = {The [hid] toolkit is a set of software objects for designingcomputer-based gestural instruments. All too frequently,computer-based performers are tied to the keyboard-mousemonitor model, narrowly constraining the range of possiblegestures. A multitude of gestural input devices are readilyavailable, making it easy to utilize a broader range of gestures. Human Interface Devices (HIDs) such as joysticks,tablets, and gamepads are cheap and can be good musicalcontrollers. Some even provide haptic feedback. The [hid]toolkit provides a unified, consistent framework for gettinggestural data from these devices, controlling the feedback,and mapping this data to the desired output. The [hid]toolkit is built in Pd, which provides an ideal platform forthis work, combining the ability to synthesize and controlaudio and video. The addition of easy access to gesturaldata allows for rapid prototypes. A usable environmentalso makes computer music instrument design accessible tonovices.},

abstract = {The HandySinger system is a personified tool developedto naturally express a singing voice controlled by the gestures of a hand puppet. Assuming that a singing voice is akind of musical expression, natural expressions of the singingvoice are important for personification. We adopt a singingvoice morphing algorithm that effectively smoothes out thestrength of expressions delivered with a singing voice. Thesystem's hand puppet consists of a glove with seven bendsensors and two pressure sensors. It sensitively capturesthe user's motion as a personified puppet's gesture. Tosynthesize the different expressional strengths of a singingvoice, the ``normal'' (without expression) voice of a particular singer is used as the base of morphing, and three different expressions, ``dark,'' ``whisper'' and ``wet,'' are used asthe target. This configuration provides musically expressedcontrols that are intuitive to users. In the experiment, weevaluate whether 1) the morphing algorithm interpolatesexpressional strength in a perceptual sense, 2) the handpuppet interface provides gesture data at sufficient resolution, and 3) the gestural mapping of the current systemworks as planned.},

abstract = {An experimental study comparing different user interfaces for a virtual drum is reported. Virtual here means that the drum is not a physical object. 16 subjects played the drum on five different interfaces and two metronome patterns trying to match their hits to the metronome clicks. Temporal accuracy of the playing was evaluated. The subjects also rated the interfaces subjectively. The results show that hitting the drum alternately from both sides with motion going through the drum plate was less accurate than the traditional one sided hitting. A physical stick was more accurate than a virtual computer graphic stick. Visual feedback of the drum slightly increased accuracy compared to receiving only auditory feedback. Most subjects evaluated the physical stick to offer a better feeling and to be more pleasant than the virtual stick. },

abstract = {In recent years Computer Network-Music has increasingly captured the attention of the Computer Music Community. With the advent of Internet communication, geographical displacement amongst the participants of a computer mediated music performance achieved world wide extension. However, when established over long distance networks, this form of musical communication has a fundamental problem: network latency (or net-delay) is an impediment for real-time collaboration. From a recent study, carried out by the ,
,
authors, a relation between network latency tolerance and Music Tempo was established. This result emerged from an experiment, in which simulated network latency conditions were applied to the performance of different musicians playing jazz standard tunes. The Public Sound Objects (PSOs) project is web-based shared musical space, which has been an experimental framework to implement and test different approaches for on-line music communication. This paper describe features implemented in the latest version of the PSOs system, including the notion of a network-music instrument incorporating latency as a software function, by dynamically adapting its tempo to the communication delay measured in real-time. },

The driver'sdecisions affect in real-time the rendering of the piece. Thepedals and wheel provide a tactile interface for controlling thecar dynamics and musical expression, while the displayportrays a first person view of the road and dashboard from thedriver's seat. This game-like interface allows non-experts tocreate expressive renderings of existing music without havingto master an instrument, and allows expert musicians toexperiment with expressive choice without having to firstmaster the notes of the piece. The prototype system has beentested and refined in numerous demonstrations. This paperpresents the concepts underlying the ESP system and thearchitectural design and implementation of a prototype.},

Work has been done by many artists and technologists in the intervening years to attempt to control music systems with brainwaves and - indeed - many other biological signals. Despite the richness of EEG, fMRI and other data which can be read from the human brain, there has up to now been only limited success in translating the complex encephalographic data into satisfactory musical results. We are currently pursuing research which we believe will lead to the possibility of direct brain-computer interfaces for rich and expressive musical control.

In this paper, we present a new time-based paradigm for programming controllers with ChucK. In addition to real-time control over sound synthesis, we show how features such as dynamic patching, on-the-fly controller mapping, multiple control rates, and precisely-timed recording and playback of sensors can be employed under the ChucK programming model. Using this framework, composers, programmers, and performers can quickly write (and read/debug) complex controller/synthesis programs, and experiment with controller mapping on-the-fly. },

With their ability to transform almost any physical objects, flat or curved surfaces and walls into interactive interfaces, acoustic sensing technologies show a promising way to bring the sense of touch into the realm of computer interaction. Because music making has been closely related to this sense during centuries, an application of particular interest is the use of TAI's for the design of new musical instruments that matches the physicality and expressiveness of classical instruments. This paper gives an overview of the various acoustic-sensing technologies involved in the realisation of TAI's and develops on the motivation underlying their use for the design of new musical instruments. },

What does one do witha complex new digital instrument?In this paper I address this question drawing on my experience in learning several very different types of sophisticatedinstruments: the Glove Talk II real-time gesture-to-speechinterface, the Digital Marionette controller for virtual 3Dpuppets, and pianos and keyboards. As the primary userof the first two systems, I have spent hundreds of hourswith Digital Marionette and Glove-Talk II, and thousandsof hours with pianos and keyboards (I continue to work asa professional musician). I will identify some of the underlying principles and approaches that I have observed duringmy learning and playing experience common to these instruments. While typical accounts of users learning new interfaces generally focus on reporting beginner's experiences, forvarious practical reasons, this is fundamentally different byfocusing on the expert's learning experience.},

In a context of music control, this assumptionimplies that a relatively low digital sample rate (100-200Hz) is sufficient to capture and/or reproduce this signal.We tested this assumption by evaluating the frequency content in breath pressure, particularly during the use of extended performance techniques such as growling, humming,and flutter tonguing. Our results indicate frequency contentin a breath pressure signal up to about 10 kHz, with especially significant energy within the first 1000 Hz. We furtherinvestigated the frequency response of several commerciallyavailable pressure sensors to assess their responsiveness tohigher frequency breath signals. Though results were mixed,some devices were found capable of sensing frequencies upto at least 1.5 kHz. Finally, similar measurements were conducted with Yamaha WX11 and WX5 wind controllers andresults suggest that their breath pressure outputs are sampled at about 320 Hz and 280 Hz, respectively.},

Rhythm action games such as Dance Dance Revolution, Taiko No Tatsujin (Taiko: Drum Master), and Donkey Konga are stimulating collaborative gameplay and exposing consumers to custom controllers designed specifically for musical and physical interaction. We are witnessing the emergence and acceptance of these breakthrough controllers and models for gameplay as an international cultural phenomenon penetrating the video game and toy markets in record numbers.

abstract = {In this paper we study the potential and the challenges posed by multi-user instruments, as tools that can facilitate interaction and responsiveness not only between performers and their instrument but also between performers as well. Several previous studies and taxonomies are mentioned, after what different paradigms exposed with examples based on traditional mechanical acoustic instruments. In the final part, several existing systems and implementations, now in the digital domain, are described and identified according to the models and paradigms previously introduced. },

We briefly discuss the test platform designed to allow for rapid experimentation of new interfaces and control mappings. We describe our design experiences and discuss the effects of system features such as latency, resolution and lack of tactile feedback. The instruments use virtual reality hardware and computer vision for user input, and three-dimensional stereo vision as well as simple desktop displays for providing visual feedback. The instrument sounds are synthesized in real-time using physical sound modeling. },

Our initial starting point was that computer music software and the way their interfaces are built need not necessarily be limited to copying the acoustic musical instruments and studio technology that we already have, but additionally we can create unique languages and work processes for the virtual world. The computer is a vast creative space with specific qualities that can and should be explored. },

Wedescribe and analyze the time-related issues we encountered whilstdesigning and building a series of interactive music exhibits thatfall into this design space. These issues often occur because ofthe varying and sometimes conflicting conceptual models of timein the three domains of user, application (music), and engineering.We present some of our latest work in conducting gesture interpretation and frameworks for digital audio, which attempt to analyzeand address these conflicts in temporal conceptual models.},

The phenomenon of gyroscopic precessioncauses the instrument to slowly oscillate when it is spunquickly, providing the performer with proprioceptive feedback. Also, due to the mass of the wheel and tire and theresulting rotational inertia, it maintains a relatively constant angular velocity once it is set in motion. Various sensors were used to measure continuous and discrete quantitiessuch as the the angular frequency of the wheel, its spatialorientation, and the performer's finger pressure. In addition, optical and hall-effect sensors detect the passing of aspoke-mounted photodiode and two magnets. A base software layer was developed in Max/MSP and various patcheswere written with the goal of mapping the dynamic behaviorof the wheel to varied musical processes.},

In its current manifestation, control data is mapped to change the processing of the instrument's natural sound in Pd (Pure Data) [3]. SCUBA preserves the unity of the solo instrument interface by acoustically mixing direct and processed sound in the instrument's bell via mounted satellite speakers, which are driven by a subwoofer below the performer's chair.

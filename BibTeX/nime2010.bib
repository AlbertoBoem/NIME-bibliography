	Abstract = {This paper investigates whether a dynamic vibrotactile feedback improves the playability of a gesture controlled virtual instrument. The instrument described in this study is based on a virtual control surface that player strikes with a hand held sensor-actuator device. We designed two tactile cues to augment the stroke across the control surface: a static and dynamic cue. The static cue was a simple burst of vibration triggered when crossing the control surface. The dynamic cue was continuous vibration increasing in amplitude when approaching the surface. We arranged an experiment to study the influence of the tactile cues in performance. In a tempo follow task, the dynamic cue yielded significantly the best temporal and periodic accuracy and control of movement velocity and amplitude. The static cue did not significantly improve the rhythmic accuracy but assisted the control of movement velocity compared to the condition without tactile feedback at all. The findings of the study indicate that careful design of dynamic vibrotactile feedback can improve the controllability of gesture based virtual instrument. },

	Abstract = {"VirtualPhilharmony" (V.P.) is a conducting interface that enables users to perform expressive music with conducting action. Several previously developed conducting interfaces do not satisfy users who have conducting experience because the feedback from the conducting action does not always correspond with a natural performance. The tempo scheduler, which is the main engine of a conducting system, must be improved. V.P. solves this problem by introducing heuristics of conducting an orchestra in detecting beats, applying rules regarding the tempo expression in a bar, etc. We confirmed with users that the system realized a high "following" performance and had musical persuasiveness. },

Worms can be manipulated using 3D interaction techniques,and several operations can be applied to the live-looping trees.

Creators of new computerbased instruments face similar design challenges as those in HCI. In the course of creating a new piece for Mobile Phone Orchestra we propose the metaphor of a sound as a ball and explore the interactions and sound mappings it suggests. These lead to the design of a gesture-controlled instrument that allows players to "bounce" sounds, "throw" them to other players, and compete in a game to "knock out" others' sounds. We composed the piece SoundBounce based on these interactions, and note that audiences seem to find performances of the piece accessible and engaging, perhaps due to the visibility of the metaphor. },

As composers explore this medium it has become evident that the nature of spatial sound perception is complex. Yet interfaces for spatial composition are often simplistic and the end results can be disappointing. This paper presents an interface that is designed to liberate the composer from thinking of spatialised sound as points in space. Instead, visual images are used to define sound in terms of shape, size and location. Images can be sequenced into video, thereby creating rich and complex temporal soundscapes. The interface offers both the ability to craft soundscapes and also compose their evolution in time. },

However, due to the need for coupling capacitorsat a sound card's inputs and outputs, the use as a genericsignal interface of a sound card is limited to signals not carrying information in a constant DC component. Through arevisit of a card design for the (now defunct) ISA bus, thispaper proposes use of analog gates for bypassing the DCfiltering input sections, controllable from software - therebyallowing for arbitrary choice by the user, if a soundcardinput channel is to be used as a generic analog-to-digitalsensor interface. Issues regarding use of obsolete technology and educational aspects are discussed as well.},

We explore three possible mechanisms how to get impact forces on mobile multi-touch devices: using built-in accelerometers, the pressure sensing capability of Android phones, and external force sensing resistors. We find that accelerometers are difficult to control for this purpose. Android's pressure sensing shows some promise, especially when combined with augmented playing technique. Force sensing resistors can offer good dynamic resolution but this technology is not currently offered in commodity devices and proper coupling of the sensor with the applied impact is difficult. },

This includes leftand right hand analysis as well as a combination of both. Inthis paper we show bow position recognition for string instruments by means of support vector regression machineson the right hand finger pressure, as well as bowing recognition and inaccurate playing detection with ordered meansmodels. We also introduce a new left hand and chin pressuresensing method for coordination and position change analysis. Our methods in combination with our audio, video,and gesture recording software can be used for teachingand exercising. Especially studies of complex movementsand finger force distribution changes can benefit from suchan approach.

We explore innovative ways to make music, create self-awareness, and provide the opportunity for unique, interactive social experiences. The system uses a multi-player game paradigm, where players work together to add layers to a soundscape of three distinct environments. Various sensors and hardware are attached to the body and transmit signals to a workstation, where they are processed using Max/MSP. The game is divided into three levels, each of a different soundscape. The underlying purpose of our system is to move the player's focus away from complexities of the modern urban world toward a more internalized meditative state. The system is currently viewed as an interactive installation piece, but future iterations have potential applications in music therapy, bio games, extended performance art, and as a prototype for new interfaces for musical expression. },

	Abstract = {This research is an initial effort in showing how a multimodal approach can improve systems for gaining insight into a musician's practice and technique. Embedding a variety of sensors inside musical instruments and synchronously recording the sensors' data along with audio, we gather a database of gestural information from multiple performers, then use machine-learning techniques to recognize which musician is performing. Our multimodal approach (using both audio and sensor data) yields promising performer classification results, which we see as a first step in a larger effort to gain insight into musicians' practice and technique. },

The interactive repertoires are therefore partially pre-determined through enculturated behaviors that are associated with particular objects, but more importantly, inextricably linked to the thematic and meaningful assemblage of the work itself. Our new work epi-thet gathers data from individual interactions with common microscopes placed on platforms within a large space. This data is correlated with public domain genetic datasets obtained from micro-array analysis. A sonification algorithm generates unique compositions associated with the spectator "as measured" through their individual specification in performing an iconic measurement action. The apparatus is a receptacle for unique compositions in sound, and invites a participatory choreography of stillness that is available for reception as a live musical performance. },

The recording system presented uses MIDI Time Code to time-stamp sensor data and to synchronize with standard video and audio recording systems.

This foamchanges electrical resistance when deformed; the controllerworks by measuring resistance at multiple points in a single piece of foam in order to track its shape. These measurements are complex and interdependent so an echo statenetwork, a form of recurrent neural network, is employed totranslate the sensor readings into usable control data.A cube shaped controller was built and evaluated in thecontext of the haptic exploration of sound synthesis parameter spaces. Eight participants experimented with the controller and were interviewed about their experiences. Thecontroller achieves its aim of enabling intuitive interaction,but in terms of nuanced interaction, accuracy and repeatability were issues for some participants. It's not clear fromthe short evaluation study whether these issues would improve with practice, a longitudinal study that gives musicians time to practice and find the creative limitations ofthe controller would help to evaluate this fully.The evaluation highlighted interesting issues concerningthe high level nature of malleable control and different approaches to sonic exploration.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the magnetic resonator piano, an augmented instrument enhancing the capabilities of the acoustic grand piano. Electromagnetic actuators induce the stringsto vibration, allowing each note to be continuously controlled in amplitude, frequency, and timbre without external loudspeakers. Feedback from a single pickup on thepiano soundboard allows the actuator waveforms to remainlocked in phase with the natural motion of each string. Wealso present an augmented piano keyboard which reportsthe continuous position of every key. Time and spatial resolution are sufficient to capture detailed data about keypress, release, pretouch, aftertouch, and other extended gestures. The system, which is designed with cost and setupconstraints in mind, seeks to give pianists continuous control over the musical sound of their instrument. The instrument has been used in concert performances, with theelectronically-actuated sounds blending with acoustic instruments naturally and without amplification.},

	Abstract = {The console gaming industry is experiencing a revolution in terms of user control, and a large part to Nintendo's introduction of the Wii remote. The online open source development community has embraced the Wii remote, integrating the inexpensive technology into numerous applications. Some of the more interesting applications demonstrate how the remote hardware can be leveraged for nonstandard uses. In this paper we describe a new way of interacting with the Wii remote and sensor bar to produce music. The Wiiolin is a virtual instrument which can mimic a violin or cello. Sensor bar motion relative to the Wii remote and button presses are analyzed in real-time to generate notes. Our design is novel in that it involves the remote's infrared camera and sensor bar as an integral part of music production, allowing users to change notes by simply altering the angle of their wrist, and henceforth, bow. The Wiiolin introduces a more realistic way of instrument interaction than other attempts that rely on button presses and accelerometer data alone. },

The audience for this new interface would be the novice programmer interested in usingmusic as part of the learning experience, though the interface should also be complex enough to benefit experiencedartist-programmers. We collected many ideas from currently available music programming languages and librariesto design and create the new capabilities in Minim. Thebasic mechanisms include chained unit generators, instruments, and notes. In general, one "patches" unit generators(for example, oscillators, delays, and envelopes) together inorder to create synthesis algorithms. These algorithms canthen either create continuous sound, or be used in instruments to play notes with specific start time and duration.We have written a base set of unit generators to enablea wide variety of synthesis options, and the capabilities ofthe unit generators, instruments, and Processing allow fora wide range of composition techniques.},

As network speeds increase and latency is consigned to history, tele-musical collaboration, and in particular improvisation will be shaped by new methodologies that respond to this potential. While networked technologies eliminate distance in physical space, for the remote improviser, this creates a liminality of experience through which their performance is mediated. As a first step in understanding the conditions arising from collaboration in networked audio platforms, this paper will examine selected case studies of improvisation in a variety of networked interfaces.

The sensors detect the movements of a performer's hands and arms in a three-dimensional space above them. The interface digitizes the output of the sensors into sets of high precision digital packets, and sends them to a patch running in Pdextended with a sufficiently high bandwidth for performances with almost no computational resource consumption in Pd. The precision, speed, and efficiency of the system enable the sonification of hand gestures in realtime without the need to attach any physical devices to the performer's body.

The software developed for the N900 mobilephone utilizes the phones built-in accelerometer sensor andBluetooth audio streaming capabilities to mix and apply effects to music using hand gestures and have the mixed audiostream to Bluetooth speakers, which allows the DJ to moveabout the environment and get familiarized with their audience, turning the experience of DJing into an interactiveand audience engaging process.Mmmmm is designed so that the DJ can utilize handgestures and haptic feedback to help them perform the various tasks involved in DJing (mixing, applying effects, andetc). This allows the DJ to focus on the crowd, thus providing the DJ a better intuition of what kind of music ormusical mixing style the audience is more likely to enjoyand engage with. Additionally, Mmmmm has an "Ambient Tempo Detection mode in which the phones camera isutilized to detect the amount of movement in the environment and suggest to the DJ the tempo of music that shouldbe played. This mode utilizes frame differencing and pixelchange overtime to get a sense of how fast the environmentis changing, loosely correlating to how fast the audience isdancing or the lights are flashing in the scene. By determining the ambient tempo of the environment the DJ canget a better sense for the type of music that would fit bestfor their venue.Mmmmm helps novice DJs achieve a better music repertoire by allowing them to interact with their audience andreceive direct feedback on their performance.

This paper describes an analysis system for point relationships that acts as a bridge between raw streams of multi-point data and the instruments they control, using a multipoint trackpad to test various configurations. The aim is to provide a practical approach for instrument programmers working with multi-point tools, while highlighting the difference between mapping systems based on point coordinate streams, grid evaluations, or object interaction and mapping systems based on multi-point data relationships. },

	Abstract = {Since 2007, our research is related to the development of an anthropomorphic saxophonist robot, which it has been designed to imitate the saxophonist playing by mechanically reproducing the organs involved for playing a saxophone. Our research aims in understanding the motor control from an engineering point of view and enabling the communication. In this paper, the Waseda Saxophone Robot No. 2 (WAS-2) which is composed by 22-DOFs is detailed. The lip mechanism of WAS-2 has been designed with 3-DOFs to control the motion of the lower, upper and sideway lips. In addition, a human-like hand (16 DOF-s) has been designed to enable to play all the keys of the instrument. Regarding the improvement of the control system, a feed-forward control system with dead-time compensation has been implemented to assure the accurate control of the air pressure. In addition, the implementation of an auditory feedback control system has been proposed and implemented in order to adjust the positioning of the physical parameters of the components of the robot by providing a pitch feedback and defining a recovery position (off-line). A set of experiments were carried out to verify the mechanical design improvements and the dynamic response of the air pressure. As a result, the range of sound pressure has been increased and the proposed control system improved the dynamic response of the air pressure control. },

We have a particular interest in embodied, embedded systems for vocal performance enhancement and transformation.

The paper provides a conceptual model of a musical work which follows compositional decision making processes. Significant features of this Fuzzy Logic framework are its inclusiveness through the consideration of all the many and varied musical details, while also incorporating the imprecision that characterises musical terminology and discourse. A significant attribute of my Fuzzy Logic method is that it traces the trajectory of all musical details, since it is both the individual elements and their combination over time which is significant to the effectiveness of a musical work in achieving its goals. The goal of this work is to find a set of elements and rules, which will ultimately enable the construction of a genralised algorithmic compositional system which can produce expressive music if so desired. },

When used in a musical context, the performer can leverage the physical reconfiguration of the device to affect the method of playing and ultimately the sound produced. We describe the implementation of the sensing system, along with a range of mapping techniques used to transform the sensor data into musical output, including both the direct synthesis of sound and also the generation of MIDI data for use with Ableton Live.

It continuously presents a predicted tone tothe user with both visual and audio feedback, thus makingit possible to design a plate with any desired shape and tone.We developed this system to demonstrate the effectivenessof integrating real-time finite element method analysis intogeometric editing to facilitate the design of custom-mademusical instruments.

The sounds generated by the traditional digital musical instruments are dependent on the physical shape of the musical instruments. The freedom of the musical performance is restricted by its structure. Therefore, the sounds cannot be generated with the body expression like the dance. We developed a ball-shaped interface, TwinkleBall, to achieve the free-style performance. A photo sensor is embedded in the translucent rubber ball to detect the grasping force of the performer. The grasping force is translated into the luminance intensity for processing. Moreover, an accelerometer is also embedded in the interface for motion sensing. By using these sensors, a performer can control the note and volume by varying grasping force and motion respectively. The features of the proposed interface are ball-shaped, wireless, and handheld size. As a result, the proposed interface is able to generate the sound from the body expression such as dance. },

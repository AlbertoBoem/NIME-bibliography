Various sensor technologies including image processing and general touch sensitive devices are employed to exploit these interaction media. The focus of our effort is to provide user-friendly and enjoyable experiences for new music and sound performances. Multimodality of musical instruments is explored in each attempt. The degree of controllability in the performance and the richness of expressions are also discussed for each installation. },

Our design criteria include initial easeof use coupled with a long term potential for virtuosity,minimal and low variance latency, and clear and simplestrategies for programming the relationship betweengesture and musical result. We present customcontrollers and unique adaptations of standard gesturalinterfaces, a programmable connectivity processor, acommunications protocol called Open Sound Control(OSC), and a variety of metaphors for musical control. We further describe applications of our technology to avariety of real musical performances and directions forfuture research.},

year = {2001},
abstract = {The MATRIX (Multipurpose Array of Tactile Rods forInteractive eXpression) is a new musical interface foramateurs and professionals alike. It gives users a 3dimensional tangible interface to control music using theirhands, and can be used in conjunction with a traditionalmusical instrument and a microphone, or as a stand-alonegestural input device. The surface of the MATRIX acts as areal-time interface that can manipulate the parameters of asynthesis engine or effect algorithm in response to aperformer's expressive gestures. One example is to have therods of the MATRIX control the individual grains of agranular synthesizer, thereby "sonically sculpting" themicrostructure of a sound. In this way, the MATRIXprovides an intuitive method of manipulating sound with avery high level of real-time control.},

year = {2001},
abstract = {In this paper, we introduce our research challenges for creating new musical instruments using everyday-life media with intimate interfaces, such as the self-body, clothes, water and stuffed toys. Various sensor technologies including image processing and general touch sensitive devices are employed to exploit these interaction media. The focus of our effort is to provide user-friendly and enjoyable experiences for new music and sound performances. Multimodality of musical instruments is explored in each attempt. The degree of controllability in the performance and the richness of expressions are also discussed for each installation. },

abstract = {In this paper we describe our efforts towards the development of live performance computer-based musical instrumentation. Our design criteria include initial ease of use coupled with a long term potential for virtuosity,minimal and low variance latency, and clear and simple strategies for programming the relationship between gesture and musical result. We present custom controllers and unique adaptations of standard gestural interfaces, a programmable connectivity processor, a communications protocol called Open Sound Control(OSC), and a variety of metaphors for musical control. We further describe applications of our technology to a variety of real musical performances and directions for future research.},

year = {2001},
abstract = {The MATRIX (Multipurpose Array of Tactile Rods for Interactive eXpression) is a new musical interface for amateurs and professionals alike. It gives users a 3dimensional tangible interface to control music using their hands, and can be used in conjunction with a traditional musical instrument and a microphone, or as a stand-alone gestural input device. The surface of the MATRIX acts as areal-time interface that can manipulate the parameters of a synthesis engine or effect algorithm in response to a performer's expressive gestures. One example is to have the rods of the MATRIX control the individual grains of a granular synthesizer, thereby "sonically sculpting" the microstructure of a sound. In this way, the MATRIX provides an intuitive method of manipulating sound with avery high level of real-time control.},

When used in conjunction with a realtime signal processing environment, the Accordiatron becomes an expressive, versatile musical instrument. A combination of sensory outputs providing both discrete and continuous data gives the subtle expressiveness and control necessary for interactive music.},

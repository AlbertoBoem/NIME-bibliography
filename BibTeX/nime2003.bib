Webelieve that the versatility of conventional musicalinstruments causes difficulty in performance. By dynamicallyspecializing a musical instrument for performing a specific(genre of) piece, the musical instrument could become moreuseful for performing the piece and facilitates expressiveperformance. Based on this idea, we developed two new typesof musical instruments, i.e., a "given-melody-based musicalinstrument" and a "harmonic-function-based musicalinstrument." From the experimental results using twoprototypes, we demonstrate the efficiency of the designprinciple.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce Block Jam, a Tangible UserInterface that controls a dynamic polyrhythmic sequencerusing 26 physical artifacts. These physical artifacts, that wecall blocks, are a new type of input device for manipulatingan interactive music system. The blocks' functional andtopological statuses are tightly coupled to an ad hocsequencer, interpreting the user's arrangement of the blocksas meaningful musical phrases and structures.We demonstrate that we have created both a tangible andvisual language that enables both the novice and musicallytrained users by taking advantage of both their explorativeand intuitive abilities. The tangible nature of the blocks andthe intuitive interface promotes face-to-face collaborationand social interaction within a single system. The principleof collaboration is further extended by linking two BlockJam systems together to create a network.We discuss our project vision, design rational, relatedworks, and the implementation of Block Jam prototypes.Figure 1.

Themain factor common to the design of most collaborativeinterfaces for novices is that musical control is highlyrestricted, which makes it possible to easily learn andparticipate in the collective experience. Balancing this tradeoff is a key concern for designers, as this happens at theexpense of providing an upward path to virtuosity with theinterface. We attempt to identify design considerationsexemplified by a sampling of recent collaborative devicesprimarily oriented toward novice interplay. It is our intentionto provide a non-technical overview of design issues inherentin configuring multiplayer experiences, particularly for entrylevel players.},

The purpose of this model is to construct acoherent and meaningful interaction between performer andinstrument. Such a model has been implicit in previous researchfor interactive performance systems. The model presented heredistinguishes gestural primitives from units of measure ofgestures. The throughput model identifies symmetry betweenperformance gestures and musical gestures, and indicates a rolefor gestural primitives when a performer navigates regions ofstable oscillations in a musical instrument. The use of a highdimensional interface tool is proposed for instrument design, forfine-tuning the mapping between movement sensor data andsound synthesis control data.},

Thisconcept enables a huge freedom in designing interfaces.

@inproceedings{Vogt:2002,
	Abstract = {Here we propose a novel musical controller which acquires imaging data of the tongue with a two-dimensional medical ultrasound scanner. A computer vision algorithm extracts from the image a discrete tongue shape to control, in realtime, a musical synthesizer and musical effects. We evaluate the mapping space between tongue shape and controller parameters and its expressive characteristics.},

	Abstract = {The design of a virtual keyboard, capable of reproducing the tactile feedback of several musical instruments is reported. The key is driven by a direct drive motor, which allows friction free operations. The force to be generated by the motor is calculated in real time by a dynamic simulator, which contains the model of mechanisms' components and constraints. Each model is tuned on the basis of measurements performed on the real system. So far, grand piano action, harpsichord and Hammond organ have been implemented successfully on the system presented here. },

Requirements for the application of multimodal interaction theory in the musical domain are discussed. We introduce the concept of bidirectional complementarity to characterize the relationship between the component sensing technologies. Each control can be used independently, but together they are mutually complementary. This reveals a fundamental difference from orthogonal systems. The creation of a concert piece based on this system is given as example. },

@inproceedings{Weinberg:2002,
	Abstract = {The Beatbugs are hand-held percussive instruments that allow the creation, manipulation, and sharing of rhythmic motifs through a simple interface. When multiple Beatbugs are connected in a network, players can form large-scale collaborative compositions by interdependently sharing and developing each other's motifs. Each Beatbug player can enter a motif that is then sent through a stochastic computerized "Nerve Center" to other players in the network. Receiving players can decide whether to develop the motif further (by continuously manipulating pitch, timbre, and rhythmic elements using two bend sensor antennae) or to keep it in their personal instrument (by entering and sending their own new motifs to the group.) The tension between the system's stochastic routing scheme and the players' improvised real-time decisions leads to an interdependent, dynamic, and constantly evolving musical experience. A musical composition entitled "Nerve" was written for the system by author Gil Weinberg. It was premiered on February 2002 as part of Tod Machover's Toy Symphony [1] in a concert with the Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin, conducted by Kent Nagano. The paper concludes with a short evaluative discussion of the concert and the weeklong workshops that led to it. },

@inproceedings{Hasan:2002,
	Abstract = {We have created a new electronic musical instrument, referred to as the Termenova (Russian for "daughter of Theremin") that combines a free-gesture capacitive sensing device with an optical sensing system that detects the reflection of a hand when it intersects a beam of an array of red lasers. The laser beams, which are made visible by a thin layer of theatrical mist, provide visual feedback and guidance to the performer to alleviate the difficulties of using a non-contact interface as well as adding an interesting component for the audience to observe. The system uses capacitive sensing to detect the proximity of the player's hands; this distance is mapped to pitch, volume, or other continuous effect. The laser guide positions are calibrated before play with position controlled servo motors interfaced to a main controller board; the location of each beam corresponds to the position where the performer should move his or her hand to achieve a pre-specified pitch and/or effect. The optical system senses the distance of the player's hands from the source of each laser beam, providing an additional dimension of musical control. },

Afasia is a one-man digital theater play in which a lone performer fitted with a sensor-suit conducts, like Homer, the whole show by himself, controlling 2D animations, DVD video and conducting the music mechanically performed by a robot quartet. After contextualizing the piece, all of its technical elements, starting with the hardware input and output components, are described. A special emphasis is given to the interactivity strategies and the subsequent software design. Since its first version premiered in Barcelona in 1998, Afasia has been performed in many European and American countries and has received several international awards. },

This was initially explored in our Musical Trinkets installation, which used magnetically-coupled resonant LC circuits to identify and track the position of multiple objects in real-time. Manipulation of these objects in free space over a read coil triggered simple musical interactions. Musical Navigatrics builds upon this success with new more sensitive and stable sensing, multi-dimensional response, and vastly more intricate musical mappings that enable full musical exploration of free space through the dynamic use and control of arpeggiatiation and effects. The addition of basic sequencing abilities also allows for the building of complex, layered musical interactions in a uniquely easy and intuitive manner. },

As the intimacy between two people increases so does their ability to anticipate and predict the other's actions. We hypothesize that this intimacy between two people can be used as a basis for new controllers for musical expression. Looking at ways people communicate non-verbally, we are developing three new instruments based on different communication channels. The Tooka is a hollow tube with a pressure sensor and buttons for each player. Players place opposite ends in their mouths and modulate the pressure in the tube with their tongues and lungs, controlling sound. Coordinated button presses control the music as well. The Pushka, yet to be built, is a semirigid rod with strain gauges and position sensors to track the rod's position. Each player holds opposite ends of the rod and manipulates it together. Bend, end point position, velocity and acceleration and torque are mapped to musical parameters. The Pullka, yet to be built, is simply a string attached at both ends with two bridges. Tension is measured with strain gauges. Players manipulate the string tension at each end together to modulate sound. We are looking at different musical mappings appropriate for two players.},

@inproceedings{Wilkerson:2002,
	Abstract = {The Mutha Rubboard is a musical controller based on the rubboard, washboard or frottoir metaphor commonly used in the Zydeco music genre of South Louisiana. It is not onlya metamorphosis of a traditional instrument, but a modern bridge of exploration into a rich musical heritage. It uses capacitive and piezo sensing technology to output MIDI and raw audio data.This new controller reads the key placement in two parallel planes by using radio capacitive sensing circuitry expanding greatly on the standard corrugated metal playing surface. The percussive output normally associated with the rubboard is captured through piezo contact sensors mounted directly on the keys (the playing implements). Additionally,mode functionality is controlled by discrete switching on the keys.This new instrument is meant to be easily played by both experienced players and those new to the rubboard. It lends itself to an expressive freedom by placing the control surface on the chest and allowing the hands to move uninhibited about it or by playing it in the usual way, preserving its musical heritage.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a subtle interface, which evolved from the design of an alternative gestural controller in the development of a performance interface. The conceptual idea used is based on that of the traditional Bodhran instrument, an Irish frame drum. The design process was user-centered and involved professional Bodhran players and through prototyping and user testing the resulting Vodhran emerged. },

	Abstract = {The use of free gesture in making music has usually been confined to instruments that use direct mappings between movement and sound space. Here we demonstrate the use of categories of gesture as the basis of musical learning and performance collaboration. These are used in a system that reinterprets the approach to learning through performance that is found in many musical cultures and discussed here through the example of Kpelle music. },

  Abstract                 = {Many mobile devices, specifically mobile phones, come equipped with a microphone. Microphones are high-fidelity sensors that can pick up sounds relating to a range of physical phenomena. Using simple feature extraction methods,parameters can be found that sensibly map to synthesis algorithms to allow expressive and interactive performance.For example blowing noise can be used as a wind instrument excitation source. Also other types of interactionscan be detected via microphones, such as striking. Hencethe microphone, in addition to allowing literal recording,serves as an additional source of input to the developingfield of mobile phone performance.},

It resulted in a distributed musical structure with up to ten interactive performance terminals distributed along the Casa da Musica's hallways, collectively controlling a shared acoustic piano. The installation allows the visitors to collaborate remotely with each other, within the building, using a software interface custom developed to facilitate collaborative music practices and with no requirements in terms previous knowledge of musical performance. },

Informal evaluation was obtained from a Reactable expert user, regarding these sets ofobjects. Experiments with the objects were also performed- related to both audio filtering, and interfacing with otherobjects for the Reactable.},

The system described, Kinetic Engine, is an environment in which individual software agents, emulate drummers improvising within a percussion ensemble. Player agents assume roles and personalities within the ensemble, and communicate with one another to create complex rhythmic interactions. In this project, the ensemble is comprised of a 12-armed musical robot, MahaDeviBot, in which each limb has its own software agent controlling what it performs. },

A pitch space arranges tones in a way that meaningful tone combinations can be easily generated. Using a touch sensitive surface or a 3D-Joystick a player can move through the pitch space and create the desired sound by selecting tones. The more optimal the tones are geometrically arranged, the less control parameters are required to move through the space and to select the desired pitches. For this the quality of pitch space based musical interfaces depends on two factors: 1. the way how the tones are organized within the pitch space and 2. the way how the parameters of a given controller are used to move through the space and to select pitches. This paper presents a musical interface based on a tonal pitch space derived from a four dimensional model found by the music psychologists [11], [2]. The proposed pitch space particularly eases the creation of tonal harmonic music. Simultaneously it outlines music psychological and theoretical principles of music. },

We have beendeveloping an audio-visual manipulation system that realizes tracks control, time-based operations and searching fortracks from massive music library. It aims to build an emotional and affecting musical interaction, and will providea better method of music listening to people. A sophisticated glove-like device with an acceleration sensor and several strain sensors has been developed. A realtime signalprocessing and musical control are executed as a result ofgesture recognition. We also developed a stand-alone device that performs as a musical controller and player at thesame time. In this paper, we describe the development of acompact and sophisticated sensor device, and demonstrateits performance of audio and video signals control.},

The termAmbient Musical Information Systems (AMIS) is proposedto describe this kind of research. Instruments like these differ from standard musical instruments in that they are tobe perceived indirectly from outside one's primary focus ofattention. We describe our rationale for creating such a device, a discussion on the appropriate qualities of sound fordelivering ambient information, and a description of an instrument created for use in a series of experiments that wewill use to test out ideas. We conclude with a discussion ofour initial findings, and some further directions we wish toexplore.},

In responding to the music and lighting you would activate more or different sounds and thereby communicate with the space through your body. This led to an artistic research project in which children's spontaneous movement was observed, a choreography made based on the children's movements and music written and recorded for the choreography. This music was then decomposed and choreographed into an empty space at Botkyrka konsthall creating an interactive dance installation. It was realized using an interactive sound and light system in which 5 video cameras were detecting the motion in the room connected to a 4-channel sound system and a set of 14 light modules. During five weeks people of all ages came to dance and move around in the installation. The installation attracted a wide range of people of all ages and the tentative evaluation indicates that it was very positively received and that it encouraged free movement in the intended way. Besides observing the activity in the installation interviews were made with schoolchildren age 7 who had participated in the installation. },

The work we present here was commissioned by a festival and ran on a daily basis over a period of three months. A GPS-enabled embedded Linux system is assembled to serve as a location-aware sound platform. Several challenges have to be overcome both technically and artistically to achieve a seamless experience and provide a simple device to be handed to the public. By building this interactive experience, which relies as much on the user's willingness to explore the invisible sonic landscape as on the ability to deploy the technology, a number of new avenues for exploring electronic music and interactivity in location-based media open up. New ways of composing music for and in a landscape and for creating audience interaction are explored. },

In the general case ofhuman-computer interfaces, users are often confined to afixed location, severely limiting mobility. To overcome thisconstraint in the context of musical interaction, we presenta system to manage large-scale collaborative mobile audioenvironments, driven by user movement. Multiple participants navigate through physical space while sharing overlaid virtual elements. Each user is equipped with a mobilecomputing device, GPS receiver, orientation sensor, microphone, headphones, or various combinations of these technologies. We investigate methods of location tracking, wireless audio streaming, and state management between mobiledevices and centralized servers. The result is a system thatallows mobile users, with subjective 3-D audio rendering,to share virtual scenes. The audio elements of these scenescan be organized into large-scale spatial audio interfaces,thus allowing for immersive mobile performance, locativeaudio installations, and many new forms of collaborativesonic activity.},

These involve the connection of three development environments: Python, SuperCollider and Processing, in order to drive kinetic art installations and to combine these with digital synthesis of sound and image in real time. By connecting these three platforms via the OSC protocol, we enable the control in real time of analog physical media (a device that draws figures on sand), sound synthesis and image synthesis. We worked on the development of algorithms for drawing figures and synthesizing images and sound on all three platforms and experimented with various mechanisms for coordinating synthesis and rendering in different media. Several problems were addressed: How to coordinate the timing between different platforms? What configuration to use? Clientserver (who is the client who the server?), equal partners, mixed configurations. A library was developed in SuperCollider to enable the packaging of algorithms into modules with automatic generation of GUI from specifications, and the saving of configurations of modules into session files as scripts in SuperCollider code. The application of this library as a framework for both driving graphic synthesis in Processing and receiving control data from it resulted in an environment for experimentation that is also being used successfully in teaching interactive audiovisual media. },

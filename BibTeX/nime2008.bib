title = {Microphone as Sensor in Mobile Phone Performance},
year = {2008},
abstract = {Many mobile devices, specifically mobile phones, come equipped with a microphone. Microphones are high-fidelity sensors that can pick up sounds relating to a range of physical phenomena. Using simple feature extraction methods,parameters can be found that sensibly map to synthesis algorithms to allow expressive and interactive performance.For example blowing noise can be used as a wind instrument excitation source. Also other types of interactionscan be detected via microphones, such as striking. Hencethe microphone, in addition to allowing literal recording,serves as an additional source of input to the developingfield of mobile phone performance.},

The project of a Public interactive installation using the PSOs system was commissioned in 2007 by Casa da Musica, the main concert hall space in Porto. It resulted in a distributed musical structure with up to ten interactive performance terminals distributed along the Casa da Musica's hallways, collectively controlling a shared acoustic piano. The installation allows the visitors to collaborate remotely with each other, within the building, using a software interface custom developed to facilitate collaborative music practices and with no requirements in terms previous knowledge of musical performance. },

The software maps soundaround the edges and responds to the user's gestural input,allowing both aural and haptic modes of interaction as well asdirect manipulation of media content. The software is designedto be very flexible and can be adapted to a wide range ofshapes. Our tests of the A20's perceptual and interactionproperties showed that users can successfully detect soundplacement, movement and haptic effects on this device. Ourparticipatory design workshops explored the possibilities of theA20 as a generative tool for the design of an extended,collaborative personal music player. The A20 helped users toenact scenarios of everyday mobile music player use and togenerate new design ideas.},

title = {Interaction with Tonal Pitch Spaces},
year = {2008},
abstract = {In this paper, we present a pitch space based musical interface approach. A pitch space arranges tones in a way that meaningful tone combinations can be easily generated. Using a touch sensitive surface or a 3D-Joystick a player can move through the pitch space and create the desired sound by selecting tones. The more optimal the tones are geometrically arranged, the less control parameters are required to move through the space and to select the desired pitches. For this the quality of pitch space based musical interfaces depends on two factors: 1. the way how the tones are organized within the pitch space and 2. the way how the parameters of a given controller are used to move through the space and to select pitches. This paper presents a musical interface based on a tonal pitch space derived from a four dimensional model found by the music psychologists [11], [2]. The proposed pitch space particularly eases the creation of tonal harmonic music. Simultaneously it outlines music psychological and theoretical principles of music. },

We present the structured design and evaluation of a set of 3D interfaces for a virtual Theremin, the VRemin. The variants differ in the size of the interaction space, the interface complexity, and the applied IO devices. We conducted a formal evaluation based on the well-known AttrakDiff questionnaire for evaluating the hedonic and pragmatic quality of interactive products. The presented work is a first approach towards a participatory design process for musical interfaces that includes user evaluation at early design phases. },

By means of a demonstrative tool, we introduce here a line of research that is at its initial stage. The envisaged goal of future developments is a novel system that could be a composing/improvising tool as well as an interface for interactive dance and performance. },

This music was then decomposed and choreographed into an empty space at Botkyrka konsthall creating an interactive dance installation. It was realized using an interactive sound and light system in which 5 video cameras were detecting the motion in the room connected to a 4-channel sound system and a set of 14 light modules. During five weeks people of all ages came to dance and move around in the installation. The installation attracted a wide range of people of all ages and the tentative evaluation indicates that it was very positively received and that it encouraged free movement in the intended way. Besides observing the activity in the installation interviews were made with schoolchildren age 7 who had participated in the installation. },

This paper discusses the general context along with the background and current developments of the project, together with an overview of the framework and discussions on a number of selected tools to support technology-enhanced music learning and teaching. },

abstract = {Moving out of doors with digital tools and electronic music and creating musically rich experiences is made possible by the increased availability of ever smaller and more powerful mobile computers. Composing music for and in a landscape instead of for a closed architectural space offers new perspectives but also raises questions about interaction and composition of electronic music. The work we present here was commissioned by a festival and ran on a daily basis over a period of three months. A GPS-enabled embedded Linux system is assembled to serve as a location-aware sound platform. Several challenges have to be overcome both technically and artistically to achieve a seamless experience and provide a simple device to be handed to the public. By building this interactive experience, which relies as much on the user's willingness to explore the invisible sonic landscape as on the ability to deploy the technology, a number of new avenues for exploring electronic music and interactivity in location-based media open up. New ways of composing music for and in a landscape and for creating audience interaction are explored. },

By connecting these three platforms via the OSC protocol, we enable the control in real time of analog physical media (a device that draws figures on sand), sound synthesis and image synthesis. We worked on the development of algorithms for drawing figures and synthesizing images and sound on all three platforms and experimented with various mechanisms for coordinating synthesis and rendering in different media. Several problems were addressed: How to coordinate the timing between different platforms? What configuration to use? Clientserver (who is the client who the server?), equal partners, mixed configurations. A library was developed in SuperCollider to enable the packaging of algorithms into modules with automatic generation of GUI from specifications, and the saving of configurations of modules into session files as scripts in SuperCollider code. The application of this library as a framework for both driving graphic synthesis in Processing and receiving control data from it resulted in an environment for experimentation that is also being used successfully in teaching interactive audiovisual media. },

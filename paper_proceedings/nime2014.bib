  Abstract                 = {We use Max/MSP framework to create a reliable but flexible approach for managing live performances of music bands who rely on live playing with digital music. This approach utilizes Max/MSP to allow any player an easy and low cost way to apply and experiment innovative music interfaces for live performance, without losing the professionalism required on stage. In that approach, every 1-3 players is plugged to a unit consisting of a standard sound-card and laptop. This unit is controlled by an interface that schedules and manages all the digital sounds made by each player (VST effects, VST instruments and 'home-made' interactive interfaces). All the player's units are then remotely controlled by a conductor patch which is in charge of the synchronization of all the players and background samples in real time, as well as providing sensitive metronome and scheduling visual enhancement. Moreover, and not less important, we can take the advantage of using virtual instruments and virtual effects in Max environment to manage the mix, and routing the audio. This providing monitors and metronome to the players ears, and virtual mixing via Max/MSP patch. This privilege almost eliminates the dependency in the venue's equipment, and in that way, the sound quality and music ideas can be taken out directly from the studio to the stage.},

Scenes that make it possible for the user to select, explore and recreate different ``sound worlds'' with the tangible interface as an instrument; create and play with it as a friend; improvise and create; or relax with it as an ambient sounding furniture. We continue discussing a user story, how the Scenes are recreated by amateur users, persons with severe disabilities and family members; improvising with the mobile tangibles. We discuss composition techniques for mixing sound, tangible-physical and lighting elements in the Scenes. Based on observations we explore how a diverse audience in the family and at school can recreate and improvise their own sound experience and play together with others. We conclude by discussing the possible impact of our findings for the NIME-community; how the techniques of decomposing, recomposing and recreating sound, based on a relational perspective, could contribute to the design of new instruments for musical expression.},

We lay out a conceptual framework for the exploration of hybrid resonant assemblages and describe how we have approached implementing them. Our performance experience is presented and implications for work are discussed. In the light of our work, we urge a reconsideration of the implicit norms of performance which underlie much research in NIME.

Understanding these perceptions might help performers better achieve their intentions, inform interface design within the NIME field and help develop theories of liveness and performance. To this end, a study of listeners' perception of liveness and performer control in laptop performance was carried out, in which listeners examined several short audio-only excerpts of laptop performances and answered questions about their perception of the performance: what they thought was happening and its sense of liveness. Our results suggest that audiences are likely to associate liveness with perceived performer activity such as improvisation and the audibility of gestures, whereas perceptions of generative material, backing tracks, or other preconceived material do not appear to inhibit perceptions of liveness.},

  Abstract                 = {Programming an audio synthesizer can be a difficult task for many. However, if a user has a general idea of the sound they are trying to program, they may be able to imitate it with their voice. This paper presents SynthAssist, a system for interactively searching the synthesis space of an audio synthesizer. In this work, we present how to use the system for querying a database of audio synthesizer patches (i.e. settings/parameters) by vocal imitation and user feedback. To account for the limitations of the human voice, it uses both absolute and relative time series representations of features and relevance feedback on both the feature weights and time series to refine the query. The method presented in this paper can be used to search through large databases of previously existing ``factory presets'' or program a synthesizer using the data-driven approach to automatic synthesizer programming.},

  Abstract                 = {Sirens evoke images of alarm, public service, war, and forthcoming air raid. Outside of the music of Edgard Varese, sirens have rarely been framed as musical instruments. By connecting air hoses to spinning disks with evenly-spaced perforations, the siren timbre is translated musically. Polyphony gives our instrument an organ-like personality: keys are mapped to different frequencies and the pressure applied to them determines volume. The siren organ can produce a large range of sounds both timbrally and dynamically. In addition to a siren timbre, the instrument produces similar sounds to a harmonica. Portability, robustness, and electronic stability are all areas for improvement.},

This paper seeks to illuminate some of the historical precedents to the scene, its primary aesthetic goals, and the divergent technological and musical approaches of representative participants. We keep in mind the novel possibilities in musical expression explored by algoravers. The scene is by no means homogeneous, and the very lack of uniformity of technique, from new live coding languages through code DJing to plug-in combination, with or without visual extension, is indicative of the flexibility of computers themselves as general information processors.},

  Abstract                 = {According to the tradition, music ensembles are usually lead by a conductor who is the responsible to coordinate and guide the group under a specific musical criteria. Similarly, computer ensembles resort to a conductor to keep the synchronization and structural coordination of the performance, often with the assistance of software. Achieving integration and coherence in a networked performance, however, can be challenging in certain scenarios. This is the case for configurations with a high degree of mutual interdependence and shared control. This paper focuses on the design strategies for developing a software based conductor assistant for collective instruments. We propose a novel conductor dimension space representation for collective instruments, which takes into account both its social and structural features. We present a case study of a collective instrument implementing a software conductor. Finally, we discuss the implications of human and machine conduction schemes in the context of the proposed dimension space.},

  Abstract                 = {Motion sensing technologies enable musical interfaces where a performer moves their body "in the air" without manipulating or contacting a physical object. These interfaces work well when the movement and sound are smooth and continuous, but it has proven difficult to design a system which triggers discrete sounds with precision that allows for complex rhythmic performance. We conducted a study where participants perform ``air-drumming'' gestures in time to rhythmic sounds. These movements are recorded, and the timing of various movement features with respect to the onset of audio events is analyzed. A novel algorithm for detecting sudden changes in direction is used to find the end of the strike gesture. We find that these occur on average after the audio onset and that this timing varies with the tempo of the movement. Sharp peaks in magnitude acceleration occur before the audio onset and do not vary with tempo. These results suggest that detecting peaks in acceleration will lead to more naturally responsive air gesture instruments.},

There is no temporal form, and all parameters of the system are controlled by the performer through an intricate but direct mapping, in an attempt to combine the experienced musician's physical control of gesture and phrasing, with the structural complexities and richness of generative music. In the first version, Circle Squared, the interface is an array of pressure sensors, and the performer performs on the system without participating directly, like a puppet master. In the second version, control parameters are derived directly from playing on the same piano that performs the output of the system. Here, the performer both plays with and on the system in an intricate dance with the unpredictable output of the unstable virtual ensemble. The underlying mapping strategies are presented, together with the structure of the generative system. Experiences from a series of performances are discussed, primarily from the perspective of the improvising musician.},

With the recent rise of tablet-based computing, the use of sketching as a control and interaction paradigm is one that deserves exploration. In this paper we present an interactive sketch-based music composition and performance system called Drawchestra. The aim of the system is to give users an intuitive way to convey their musical ideas to a computer system with the minimum of technical training thus enabling them to focus on the creative tasks of composition and performance. The system provides the user with a canvas upon which they may create their own instruments by sketching shapes on the tablet screen. The system recognises a certain set of shapes which it treats as virtual instruments or effects. Once recognised, these virtual instruments can then be played by the user in real time. The size of a sketched instrument shape is used to control certain parameters of the sound so the user can build complex orchestras containing many different shapes of different sizes. The sketched shapes may also be moved and resized as desired making it possible to customise and edit the virtual orchestra as the user goes along. The system has been implemented in Python and user tests conducted using an iPad as the control surface. We report the results of the user study at the end of the paper before briefly discussing the outcome and outlining the next steps for the system design.},

The rings sound loudly when they touch a hard object, and are practically silent otherwise. When a wearer touches their own (or someone else's) head, the contacted person hears the sound through bone conduction, inaudible to others. The bracelet contains a microcontroller, a set of FET transistors, an accelerometer, and a battery. The microcontroller generates a separate audio signal for each ring, switched through the FETs, and can take user input through the accelerometer in the form of taps, flicks, and other gestures. The player controls the envelope and timbre of the sound by varying the physical pressure and the angle of their finger on the surface, or by touching differently resonant surfaces. Because its sound is shaped by direct, physical contact with objects and people, the FingerSynth encourages players to experiment with the materials around them and with one another, making music with everything they touch.},

The EEG of the vocalist and one audience member is measured throughout the performance and the system generates a real-time score based on mapping the emotional features within the EEG. We measure the two emotional descriptors, valence and arousal, within EEG and map the two-dimensional correlate of averaged windows to musical phrases. These pre-composed phrases contain associated emotional content based on the KTH Performance Rules System (Director Musices). The piece is in three movements, the first two are led by the emotions of each subject respectively, whilst the third movement interpolates the combined response of the performer and audience member. The system not only aims to reflect the individuals' emotional states but also attempts to induce a shared emotional experience by drawing the two responses together.

  Abstract                 = {In the paper I present a robotic device that offers new ways of interaction for producing rhythmic patterns. The apparatus is placed on an overhead projector and a visual presentation of these rhythmic patterns is delivered as a shadow play. The rhythmic patterns can be manipulated by modifying the environment of the robot, through direct physical interaction with the robot, by rewiring the internal connectivity, and by adjusting internal parameters. The theory of embodied cognition provides the theoretical basis of this device. The core postulate of embodied cognition is that biological behavior can only be understood through an understanding of the real-time interactions of an organism's nervous system, the organism's body and the environment. One the one hand the device illustrates this theory because the patterns that are created equally depend on the real-time interactions of the electronics, the physical structure of the device and the environment. On the other hand the device presents a synthesis of these ideas and it is effectively possible to play with it at all the three levels, the electronics, the physical configuration of the robot and the environment.},

We present a system for sample exploration that allows audio clips to be sorted according to user taste, and arranged in any desired 2D formation such that similar samples are located near each other. Our method relies on two advances in machine learning. First, metric learning allows the user to shape the audio feature space to match their own preferences. Second, kernelized sorting finds an optimal arrangement for the samples in 2D. We demonstrate our system with two new interfaces for exploring audio samples, and evaluate the technology qualitatively and quantitatively via a pair of user studies.},

In this work, we introduce a means of creating tree-like signal graphs that dynamically change their routing in response to changes in the location of the unit generators in a virtual space. Signals are rerouted using a crossfading scheme that avoids the harsh clicks and pops associated with amplitude discontinuities. The unit generators are easily controllable using a click and drag interface that responds using familiar physics. CollideFx brings the interactivity of a video game together with the purpose of creating interesting and complex audio effects. With little difficulty, users can craft custom effects, or alternatively, can fling a unit generator into a cluster of several others to obtain more surprising results, letting the physics engine do the decision making.},

In our example we illustrate this concept by using the audiovisual recording of an instrumental performance as a source. Our system provides an alternative interface to the musical instrument's audiovisual corpus: as the instrument's sound and behavior is accessed in ways that are not possible on the instrument itself, the resulting non-linear playback of the grains generates an instant remix in a cut-up aesthetic. The presented instrument is a human-computer interface that employs the structural outcome of machine analysis accessing audiovisual corpora in the context of a musical performance.},

These gestural materials are used to provide the basis for the structures of relational mappings, informed by the embodied image schema structures of Lakoff and Johnson. These theoretical perspectives are refined via larger-scale ecological-embodied structural relationships in electroacoustic music outlined in Smalley's theory of spectromorphology, alongside the incorporation of an additional active-agential response structure through the use of the boids flocking algorithm by Reynolds to control the spatialization of outputs and other textural processes. The paper aims to advance a broadly-applicable 'performance gesture ecology', providing a shared spatial-relational mapping (a 'basic gestural space') which allows for creative (but still coherent) mappings from the performance gestures to the control of textural and spatial structures.},

This paper is a reflection on these and other considerations gained from the experience of designing and constructing endo/exo as well as future implications for the Honeycomb platform as a tool for creating musical interactions within a new paradigm which allows for emergent behavior across vast physical spaces. The use of swarming and self-organization, as well as playful interaction, creates an ``aliveness'' in the mechanism, and renders its exploration pleasurable, intriguing and uncanny.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of artists who make use of automated music performances in their music and live concerts. Automated music performance is a form of music production using programmed musical notes. Some artists who introduce automated music performance operate parameters of the sound in their performance for production of their music. In this paper, we focus on the music production aspects and describe a method that realizes operation of the sound parameters via computer. Further, in this study, the probability distribution of the action (i.e., variation of parameters) is obtained within the music, using Bayesian filters. The probability distribution of each piece of music is transformed by passing through a Markov model. After the probability distribution is obtained, sound parameters can be automatically controlled. We have developed a system to reproduce the musical expressions of humans and confirmed the possibilities of our method.},

  Abstract                 = {Music plays a vital role in accompanying all manner of our experiences. Soundtracks within films, video games and ceremonies possess a unique ability to enhance a narrative, suggest emotional content and mark key transitions. Moreover, soundtracks often achieve all of this without being the primary focus, on the contrary they typically assume a supporting role. The proliferation of mobile devices increasingly leads us to listen to music while on the move and musicians are seizing on locative technologies as a tool for creating new kinds of music that directly respond to people's movements through space. In light of these trends, we consider the interesting question of how composers might set about creating musical soundtracks to accompany mobile experiences. What we have in mind are experiences such as guided walks, tours and even pervasive games. The novelty of our research here is in the music serving as an accompaniment to enhance a location specific activity, much as a soundtrack does for a film. This calls for composers to take into account the key features of the experience, and its setting, to gently complement them through the music. We examine this process from a composer's perspective by presenting `from the field' an account of how they address the multifaceted challenges of designing a soundtrack for public sculpture park. We chart a composer's rationale as they developed a soundtrack for this site over multiple iterations of design, testing and refinement. We expose key relationships between the raw materials of music (melody, harmony, timbre, rhythm and dynamics) and those of the physical setting, that enable the composer to gracefully mesh the music into the fabric of the space. The result is to propose a set of recommendations to inform the composition of mobile soundtracks that we intend to guide future practice and research.},

Digital vinyl systems combine the distinct haptic nature of the analog turntable with the advantages of digital media. They use special records containing a digital timecode which is then processed by a computer and mapped to properties like playback speed and direction. These records, however, are generic and, in contrast to traditional vinyl, do not provide visual cues representing the structure of the track. We present a system that augments the timecode record with a visualization of song information such as artist, title, and track length, but also with a waveform that allows to visually navigate to a certain beat. We conducted a survey examining the acceptance of such tools in the DJ community and conducted a user study with professional DJs. The system was widely accepted as a tool in the DJ community and received very positive feedback during observational mixing sessions with four professional DJs.},

The more computers involved the longer the setup and tear-down of a performance. Each computer adds power and cabling requirements that the venue must accommodate. Cloud computing can change of all this by simplifying the setup of many (10s, 100s) of machines at the click of a button. But there's a catch, the cloud is not physically near you, you cannot run an audio cable to the cloud. The audio from a computer music instrument in the cloud needs to streamed back to the performer and listeners. There are many solutions for streaming audio over networks and the internet, most of them suffer from high latency, heavy buffering, or proprietary/non-portable clients. In this paper we propose a portable cloud-friendly method of streaming, almost a cloud soundcard, whereby performers can use mobile devices (Android, iOS, laptops) to stream audio from the cloud with far lower latency than technologies like icecast. This technology enables near-realtime control over power computer music networks enabling performers to travel light and perform live with more computers than ever before.},

Inspired by the Touch{\'e} project, this paper discusses how to implement this technique using the community standard hardware Arduino instead of custom designed electronics. The technique requires only passive components and can be used to enhance the touch sensitivity of many everyday objects and even biological materials and substances such as plants, which this paper will focus on as a case study through the project known as Cultivating Frequencies. This paper will discuss different techniques of filtering data captured by this system, different methods for creating gesture recognition unique to the object being used, and the implications of this technology as it pertains to the goal of ubiquitous sensing.

The fundamental human constraints and processes that govern eye movements create a challenge for eye-controlled music in that the instrument needs to be designed to motivate or at least permit specific unique visual goals, each of which when accomplished must then be mapped, using the eye tracker and some sort of sound generator, to different musical outcomes.

  Abstract                 = {We present a framework for imitation of percussion performances with parameter-based learning for accurate reproduction. We constructed a robotic setup involving pull-solenoids attached to drum sticks which communicate with a computer through an Arduino microcontroller. The imitation framework allows for parameter adaptation to different mechanical constructions by learning the capabilities of the overall system being used. For the rhythmic vocabulary, we have considered regular stroke, flam and drag styles. A learning and calibration system was developed to efficiently perform grace notes for the drag rudiment as well as the single stroke and the flam rudiment. A second pre-performance process is introduced to minimize the latency difference between individual drum sticks in our mechanical setup. We also developed an off-line onset detection method to reliably recognize onsets from the microphone input. Once these pre-performance steps are taken, our setup will then listen to a human drummer's performance pattern, analyze for onsets, loudness, and rudiment pattern, and then play back using the learned parameters for the particular system. We conducted three different evaluations of our constructed system.},

  Abstract                 = {The term 'gesture' has represented a buzzword in the NIME community since the beginning of its conference series. But how often is it actually used, what is it used to describe, and how does its usage here differ from its usage in other fields of study? This paper presents a linguistic analysis of the motion-related terminology used in all of the papers published in the NIME conference proceedings to date (2001-2013). The results show that 'gesture' is in fact used in 62 % of all NIME papers, which is a significantly higher percentage than in other music conferences (ICMC and SMC), and much more frequently than it is used in the HCI and biomechanics communities. The results from a collocation analysis support the claim that 'gesture' is used broadly in the NIME community, and indicate that it ranges from the description of concrete human motion and system control to quite metaphorical applications.},

Using inaudible sound as a data medium, a digital data network among the audience and performer can be easily built with microphones and speakers, without requiring any additional hardware. ``TAPIR Sound Tag'' is a smart device framework for inaudible data communication that can be easily embedded in audience participatory performances and interactive arts. With a bandwidth of 900 Hz, a high transmission rate of 200 bps can be achieved, enabling peer-to-peer or broadcasting real-time data communication among smart devices. This system can be used without any advanced knowledge in signal processing and communication system theory; simply specifying carrier frequency and bandwidth with a few lines of code can start data communication. Several usage scenarios of the system are also presented, such as participating in an interactive performance by adding and controlling sound, and collaborative completion of an artist's work by audience. We expect this framework to provide a new way of audience interaction to artists, as well as further promoting audience participation by simplifying the process: using personal smart devices as a medium and not requiring additional hardware or complex settings.},

This approach has been applied in a master course focused on the exploration of expressiveness and on the role of the mapping component in the NIME creation chain, through hands-on and self-reflective approach based on a restrictive setup consisting of smart-phones and the Pd programming language. Working Groups were formed, and a 2-step DMI design process was applied, including 2 performance stages. The evaluation tools assessed both System and Performance aspects of each project, according to Listeners' impressions after each performance. Listeners' previous music knowledge was also considered. Through this methodology, students with different backgrounds were able to effectively engage in the NIME design processes, developing working DMI prototypes according to the demanded requirements; the assessment tools proved to be consistent for evaluating NIMEs systems and performances, and the fact of informing the design processes with the outcome of the evaluation, showed a traceable progress in the students outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Echo State Networks (ESNs), a form of recurrent neural network developed in the field of Reservoir Computing, show significant potential for use as a tool in the design of mappings for digital musical instruments. They have, however, seldom been used in this area, so this paper explores their possible uses. This project contributes a new open source library, which was developed to allow ESNs to run in the Pure Data dataflow environment. Several use cases were explored, focusing on addressing current issues in mapping research. ESNs were found to work successfully in scenarios of pattern classification, multiparametric control, explorative mapping and the design of nonlinearities and uncontrol. \emph{Un-trained} behaviours are proposed, as augmentations to the conventional reservoir system that allow the player to introduce potentially interesting non-linearities and uncontrol into the reservoir. Interactive evolution style controls are proposed as strategies to help design these behaviours, which are otherwise dependent on arbitrary parameters. A study on sound classification shows that ESNs can reliably differentiate between two drum sounds, and also generalise to other similar input. Following evaluation of the use cases, heuristics are proposed to aid the use of ESNs in computer music scenarios.},

For the purposes of this research a laptop ensemble is defined as a performing group of three or more musicians for whom the laptop is the main sound generating source and who typically perform together in the same room. The concept of democracy (i.e. governance by members of the group) has been used as a starting point to assess firstly what types of organisational structures are currently used in laptop ensembles and secondarily to what extent laptop ensembles consider the implications of organisational and social structure on their musical output. To assess this I recorded a number of data points including ensemble size, whether the group has a director or conductor, use of homogenous vs. heterogenous hardware and software, whether they perform composed pieces or mainly improvise, the level of network interaction and whether or not the ensemble has an academic affiliation. The survey allowed me to define a scale of democracy in laptop ensembles and typical features of the most and least democratic groups. Some examples are given of democratic and autocratic activity in existing laptop ensembles. This work is part of a larger scale project investigating the effect of social structures on the musical output of laptop ensembles.},

The paper describes the main challenges encountered in the use of structure-borne sound technology, as well as the current results in overcoming them. Two completed artistic projects are presented in order to illustrate the creative possibilities enabled by the research.},

  Abstract                 = {People with a physical handicap are often not able to engage and embrace the world of music on the same terms as normal functioning people. Musical instruments have been refined the last centuries which makes them highly specialized instruments that nearly all requires at least two functioning hands. In this study we try to enable people with hemiplegia to play a real electrical guitar by modifying it in a way that make people with hemiplegia able to actually play the guitar. We developed the guitar platform to utilize sensors to capture the rhythmic motion of alternative fully functioning limbs, such as a foot, knee or the head to activate a motorized fader moving a pick back and forth across the strings. The approach employs the flexibility of a programmable digital system which allows us to scale and map different ranges of data from various sensors to the motion of the actuator and thereby making it easier adapt to individual users. To validate and test the instrument platform we collaborated with the Helena Elsass Center during their 2013 Summer Camp to see if we actually succeeded in creating an electrical guitar that children with hemiplegia could actually play. The initial user studies showed that children with hemiplegia were able to play the actuated guitar by producing rhythmical movement across the strings that enables them to enter a world of music they so often see as closed.},

The app displays the current chord in the Roman numeral and suggests the expected next chord in an easy to understand way on a smartphone. This work investigates into the human computer interaction perspective of music performance. We use a smartphone app as a bridge, which assists musician to react faster in music jamming by transforming the complex music knowledge into a simple, unified and easy to understand format. Experiment result shows that this app can help the non-keyboardist musician to learn pop music jamming. It also shows that the app is useful to assist keyboardist in making key transpose and playing music in the key with many sharps and flats.

Performances with a prototype gestural performance system, Gestate, provide the basis for insights into the application of gestural systems in live contexts. These reflections stem from a performer's perspective, outlining the experience of prototyping and performing with augmented instruments that extend vocal or instrumental technique through ancillary gestures. Successful implementation of rapidly evolving gestural technologies in real-time performance calls for new approaches to performing and musicianship, centred around a growing understanding of the body's physical and creative potential. For musicians hoping to incorporate gestural control seamlessly into their performance practice a balance of technical mastery and kinaesthetic awareness is needed to adapt existing systems to their own purposes. Within non-tactile systems, visual feedback mechanisms can support this process by providing explicit visual cues that compensate for the absence of haptic or tangible feedback. Experience gained through prototyping and performance can yield a deeper understanding of the broader nature of gestural control and the way in which performers inhabit their own bodies.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) have difficulties establishing themselves after their creation. A huge number of DMIs is presented every year and few of them actually remain in use. Several causes could explain this reality, among them the lack of a proper instrumental technique, inadequacy of the traditional musical notation and the non-existence of a repertoire dedicated to the instrument. In this paper we present Entoa, the first written music for Intonaspacio, a DMI we designed in our research project. We propose some strategies for mapping data from sensors to sound processing, in order to accomplish an expressive performance. Entoa is divided in five different sections that corresponds to five movements. For each, a different mapping is designed, introducing subtle alterations that progressively explore the ensemble of features of the instrument. The performer is then required to adapt his repertoire of gestures along the piece. Indications are expressed through a gestural notation, where freedom is give to performer to control certain parameters at specific moments in the music.},

He concludes that no single strategy constitutes a solution to the issue of mapping and that musical compositions are complex entities that require the use of a multitude of mapping strategies in parallel.

Many amazing languages and tools such as SuperCollider, ChucK, and Max/MSP all facilitate networking and collaboration, however these languages and tools were not created explicitly to make group performances simple and intuitive. New web standards such as Web Audio and Web GL introduce the capability for web browsers to duplicate many of the features in computer music tools.

  Abstract                 = {Wireless technology is growing increasingly prevalent in the development of new interfaces for live music performance. However, with a number of different wireless technologies operating in the 2.4 GHz band, there is a high risk of interference and congestion, which has the potential to severely disrupt live performances. With its high transmission power, channel bandwidth and throughput, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) presents an opportunity for highly robust wireless communications. This paper presents our preliminary work optimising the components of a Wi-Fi system for live performance scenarios. We summarise the manufacture and testing of a prototype directional antenna that is designed to maximise sensitivity to a performer's signal while suppressing interference from elsewhere. We also propose a set of recommended Wi-Fi configurations to reduce latency and increase throughput. Practical investigations utilising these arrangements demonstrate a single x-OSC device achieving a latency of <3 ms and a distributed network of 15 devices achieving a net throughput of ~4800 packets per second (~320 per device); where each packet is a 104-byte OSC message containing 16 analogue input channels acquired by the device.},

Links are suggested between the sonic affordances of each instrument and the dynamical mechanisms embedded in them. This is discussed in the context of contemporary, materialoriented approaches to composition and particularly to free improvisation where elements such as unpredictability and instability are often of interest, and the process of exploration and discovery is an important part of the practice. Links are also made with the use of dynamical interactions in computer games to produce situations in which slight variations in the timing and ordering of inputs can lead to very different outcomes, encouraging similarly explorative approaches.},

Such a technique is useful for robots consisting of many strings: the ability to self-tune allows for long-term installation without human intervention as well as on-the-fly tuning scheme changes. The presented method consists of comparing a detuned string's pitch at runtime to a pre-compiled table of string responses at varying tensions. The behavior of the current detuned string is interpolated from the two nearest pre-characterized neighbors, and the desired virtual fret positions are added to the interpolated model. This method allows for rapid tuning at runtime, requiring only a single string actuation to determine the pitch. After a detailed description of the self-tuning technique and implementation, the results will be evaluated on the new Swivel 2 robotic slide guitar. The paper concludes with a discussion of performance applications and ideas for subsequent work on self-tuning musical robotic systems.},

In addition, participants can change master/slave role between performers immediately. Our primary motivation is to provide musicians and nonmusicians with opportunities to experience a collaborative electronic music performance. Here, the hardware and interaction design of the device is presented. To date, numerous collaborative musical instruments have been developed in electronic music field [1][2][3]. The authors are interested in formations of musical sessions using stand-alone devices and leader/follower relationship in musical sessions. The authors specify three important requirements of instrument design for musical session. They are as follows: (1) Simple Interface: Interface that enables performers to control three sound elements (pitch, timbre, and amplitude) with simple interaction. (2) Portable Stand-alone System: System that runs standalone (with sound generators, speakers, and butteries). Because musical sessions can be improvised at any place and time, the authors consider that portability is essential in designing musical instruments for sessions. (3) Wireless Synchronization: System that supports ensembles by automatically synchronizing tempo (BPM) and tonality between multiple devices by air because of portability. In addition, performers can switch master/slave roles smoothly such as leader/follower relationship during a musical session. The authors gave ten live performances using this device at domestic and international events. In these events, the authors confirmed that our proposed wireless synchronization system worked stable. It is suggested that our system demonstrate the practicality of wireless synchronization. In future, the authors will evaluate the device in terms of its stability in multi-performer musical sessions.},

Following the paradigm of spreadsheets, an established model of end-user programming, Manhattan is designed to bridge the gap between traditional music editing methods (such as MIDI sequencing and typesetting) and generative and algorithmic music -seeking both to reduce the learning threshold of programming and support flexible integration of static and dynamic musical elements in a single work. Interaction draws on rudimentary knowledge of mathematics and spreadsheets to augment the sequencer notation with programming concepts such as expressions, built-in functions, variables, pointers and arrays, iteration (for loops), branching (goto), and conditional statements (if-then-else). In contrast to other programming tools, formulas emphasise the visibility of musical data (e.g. notes), rather than code, but also allow composers to interact with notated music from a more abstract perspective of musical processes. To illustrate the function and use cases of the system, several examples of traditional and generative music are provided, the latter drawing on minimalism (process-based music) as an accessible introduction to algorithmic composition. Throughout, the system and approach are evaluated using the cognitive dimensions of notations framework, together with early feedback for use by artists.},

Another goal of this work is wider platform accessibility for players, via a simple `do-it-yourself' approach described by the design herein. While the hardware and software elements are open source, the build process can nonetheless require non-insignificant investments of time and money, as well as basic electronics construction skills. These have been kept to a minimum wherever possible. Our initial prototype is based upon an inexpensive electric violin that is widely available online for approximately $200 USD. This serves as the starting point for construction, to which the design adds local Digital Signal Processing (DSP), gestural sensing, and sound output. Real-time DSP algorithms are running on a mobile device, which also incorporates orientation/gesture sensors for parameter mapping, with the resulting sound amplified and rendered via small loudspeakers mounted on the instrument. The platform combines all necessary elements for digitally-mediated interactive performance; the need for a traditional computer only arises when developing new DSP algorithms for the platform. An initial exploratory evaluation with users is presented, in which performers explore different possibilities with the proposed platform (various DSP implementations, mapping schemes, physical setups, etc.) in order to better establish the needs of the performing artist. Based on these results, future work is outlined leading towards the development of a complete quartet of instruments.},

Most audio-only pitch tracking algorithms face a fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and latency, with longer analysis windows producing better pitch estimates at the cost of noticeable lag in a live performance environment. Conversely, sensor-only strategies struggle to achieve the fine pitch accuracy a human listener would expect.

  Abstract                 = {Conceiving digital musical instruments might be challenging in terms of spectator accessibility. Depending on the interface and the complexity of the software used as a transition between the controller and sound, a musician performance can be totally opaque for the audience and loose its interest. This paper examines the possibility of adding a visual feedback to help the public understanding, and add expressivity to the performance. It explores the various mapping organizations between controller and sound, giving different spaces of representation for the visual feedback. It can be either an amplification of the controller parameters, or a representation of the related musical parameters. Different examples of visualization are presented and evaluated, taking the Cantor Digitalis as a support. It appears the representation of musical parameters, little used compared to the representation of controllers, received a good opinion from the audience, highlighting the musical intention of the performers.},

During performance, the percussionist equally manipulates and expresses through two surfaces, an iPad displaying an interactive touch screen and a snare drum augmented with various foreign objects, including a contact microphone adhered to the drumhead's surface. A computer program created for this composition runs on a laptop computer in front of the percussionist. The software captures sound from the contact microphone and transforms this sound through audio signal processing controlled by the performer's gestures on the iPad. The computer screen displays an animated graphic score, as well as the current states of iPad controls and audio signal processing, for the performer. Many compositional and technological approaches used in this project pay tribute to composer John Cage, since the premiere performance of Engravings for Prepared Snare Drum, iPad, and Computer took place in 2012, the centennial celebration of Cage's birth year.},

An array of hall-effect sensors and their vicinity make up a continuous 2D interaction space. The sensors are excited with Neodymium magnets worn on fingers. The device continuously tracks position and vicinity of multiple present magnets along the sensor array to produce event signals accordingly. Apart from the two positional signals, an event also carries the magnetic field polarization, a unique identifier and group association. We like to think of it as a mixed analog/digital offspring of theremin and trautonium. These general-purpose event signals are transmitted and eventually translated into musical events according to custom mappings on a host system. With its touch-less control (no friction), high update rates (2-4kHz), its quasi-continuous spatial resolution and its low-latency (<1 ms), the Chimaera can react to most subtle motions instantaneously and allows for a highly dynamic and expressive play. Its open source design additionally gives the user all possibilities to further tune hardware and firmware to his or her needs. The Chimaera is network-oriented and configured with and communicated by OSC (Open Sound Control), which makes it straight-forward to integrate into any setup.},

To provide the user with a heightened sense of sound spatialization over the traditional channel strip, the concept of depth is addressed directly using the stage metaphor. Sound sources are represented as colored spheres in a graphical user interface to provide the user with visual feedback. Moving sources back and forward controls volume, while left to right controls panning. To provide broader accessibility, the interface is configured to control mixing within the Ableton Live DAW.

The goal of this study is to analyze, following the path initiated by this latter kind of works, how simple motion capture descriptors can explain the relationship between the loudness of a given performance and the way in which different subjects move when asked to impersonate the conductor of that performance. Twenty-five subjects were asked to impersonate the conductor of three classical music fragments while listening to them. The results of different linear regression models with motion capture descriptors as explanatory variables show that, by studying how descriptors correlate to loudness differently among subjects, different tendencies can be found and exploited to design models that better adjust to their expectations.},

  Abstract                 = {In the recent years many touch screen interfaces have been designed and used for musical control. When compared with their physical counterparts, current control paradigms employed in touch screen musical interfaces do not require the same level of physical labor and this negatively affects the user experience in terms of expressivity, engagement and enjoyment. This lack of physicality can be remedied by using interaction elements, which are designed for the exertion of the user. Employing intentionally difficult and inefficient interaction design can enhance the user experience by allowing greater bodily expression, kinesthetic feedback, more apparent skill acquisition, and performer satisfaction. Rub Synth is a touch screen musical instrument with an exertion interface. It was made for creating and testing exertion strategies that are possible by only using 2d touch coordinates as input and evaluating the outcomes of implementing intentional difficulty. This paper discusses the strategies that can be employed to model effort on touch screens, the benefits of having physical difficulty, Rub Synth's interaction design, and user experience results of using such an interface.},

For each of the systems we evaluated if and why APS would be a contender or not. The results showed that for over 73 percent of the reviewed applications, APS could possibly provide competitive alternatives and at very low cost.},

We use convolution to excite the grains from the corpus via the microphone input, capturing the contact interaction sounds, which allows articulation of the corpus by hitting, scratching, or strumming a surface with various parts of the hands or objects. We also show how changes of grains have to be carefully handled, how one can smoothly interpolate between neighbouring grains, and finally evaluate the system against previous attempts.},

There have been many examples of such use, including sound-responsive visualisations, adaptive audio effects and machine musicianship. However, at present, using audio analysis algorithms in live performance requires either some detailed knowledge about the algorithms themselves, or programming or both. Those wishing to use audio analysis in live performances may not have either of these as their strengths. Rather, they may instead wish to focus upon systems that respond to audio analysis data, such as visual projections or sound generators. In response, this paper introduces the Sound Analyser an audio plug-in allowing users to a) select a custom set of audio analyses to be performed in real-time and b) send that information via OSC so that it can easily be used by other systems to develop responsive applications for live performances and installations. A description of the system architecture and audio analysis algorithms implemented in the plug-in is presented before moving on to two case studies where the plug-in has been used in the field with artists.},

Notes are played by touch, but are sustained through continuous movement. Pitch bends can be achieved by passing through the space between the notes. Its current implementation runs only on Apple iPad tablet computers using a libPd to convert user interaction into audio. An iPad overlay offers physical feedback for the circles as well as the pitch bend area between the circles.

  Abstract                 = {For the electric guitar, which takes a large proportion in modern pop music, effects unit (or effector) is no longer optional. Many guitarists already `play' their effects with their instrument. However, it is not easy to control these effects during the play, so lots of new controllers and interfaces have been devised; one example is a pedal type effects that helps players to control effects with a foot while their hands are busy. Some players put a controller on their guitars. However, our instruments are so precious to drill a hole, and the stage is too big for the player who is just kneeling behind the pedals and turning the knobs. In this paper, we designed a new control system for electric guitar and bass. This paper is about a gesture-based sound control system that controls the electric guitar effects (like delay time, reverberation or pitch) with the player's hand gesture. This system utilizes TAPIR signal to trace player's hand motion. TAPIR signal is an acoustic signal that can rarely be received by most people, because its frequency exists between 18 kHz to 22 kHz [TAPIR article]. This system consists of a signal generator, an electric guitar and a sound processor. From the generator that is attached on the player's hand, the TAPIR signal transfers to the magnetic pickup equipped on the electric guitar. Player's gesture is captured as a Doppler shift and the processor calculates the value as the sound effect parameter. In this paper, we focused on the demonstration of the signal transfer on aforementioned system.},

  Abstract                 = {The El-Lamellophone (El-La) is a Lamellophone hyperinstrument incorporating electronic sensors and integrated DSP. Initial investigations have been made into digitallycontrolled physical actuation of the acoustic tines. An embedded Linux micro-computer supplants the laptop. A piezoelectric pickup is mounted to the underside of the body of the instrument for direct audio acquisition providing a robust signal with little interference. The signal is used for electric sound-reinforcement, creative signal processing and audio analysis developed in Puredata (Pd). This signal inputs and outputs the micro computer via stereo 1/8th inch phono jacks. Sensors provide gesture recognition affording the performer a broader, more dynamic range of musical human computer interaction (MHCI) over specific DSP functions. Work has been done toward electromagnetic actuation of the tines, aiming to allow performer control and sensation via both traditional Lamellophone techniques, as well as extended playing techniques that incorporate shared human/computer control of the resulting sound. The goal is to achieve this without compromising the traditional sound production methods of the acoustic instrument while leveraging inherent performance gestures with embedded continuous controller values essential to MHCI. The result is an intuitive, performer designed, hybrid electro-acoustic instrument, idiomatic computer interface, and robotic acoustic instrument in one framework.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic feedback controllers (AFCs) are typically applied to solve feedback problems evident in applications such as public address (PA) systems, hearing aids, and speech applications. Applying the techniques of AFCs to different contexts, such as musical performance, sound installations, and product design, presents a unique insight into the research of embodied sonic interfaces and environments. This paper presents techniques that use digital acoustic feedback control algorithms to augment the sonic properties of environments and discusses approaches to the design of sonically playful experiences that apply such techniques. Three experimental prototypes are described to illustrate how the techniques can be applied to versatile environments and continuous coupling of users' audible actions with sonically augmented environments. The knowledge obtained from these prototypes has led to Acoustic Feedback Ecology System (AFES) design patterns. The paper concludes with some future research directions based on the prototypes and proposes several other potentially useful applications ranging from musical performance to everyday contexts.},

We begin by outlining primary challenges associated with DMI design, focussing on the specific problems Orphion seeks to address such as requirements for haptic feedback from the device. Orphion achieves this by incorporating an interaction model based on tonally tuned virtual ``pads'' in user-configurable layouts, where the pitch and timbre associated with each pad depends on the initial point of touch, touch point size and size variation, and position after the initial touch. These parameters control a physical model for sound generation with visual feedback provided via the iPad display. We present findings from the research and development process including design revisions made in response to user testing. Finally, conclusions are made about the effectiveness of the instrument based on large-scale user feedback.},

The aim of the studies was to investigate the perceived similarity and the efficacy of two multidimensional mappings each consisting of three audio-visual associations. The purpose of the mappings is to enable visual control of corpus-based concatenative synthesis. More specifically the stimuli in the first study was designed to test the perceived similarity of six audio-visual associations, between the two mappings using three corpora resulting in 18 audio-visual stimuli. The corpora differ in terms of two sound characteristics: harmonic contain and continuity. Data analysis revealed no significant differences in the participant's responses between the three corpora, or between the two mappings. However highly significant differences were revealed between the individual audio-visual association pairs. The second study investigates the affects of the mapping and the corpus in the ability of the participants to detect which image out of three similar images was used to generate six audio stimuli. The data analysis revealed significant differences in the ability of the participants' to detect the correct image depending on which corpus was used. Less significant was the effect of the mapping in the success rate of the participant responses.},

We claim that these two cases require different gesture-to-parameter mapping properties. Results are presented from a user experiment that motivates this theory. The experiment was conducted using a publicly available iPad app: ``Sonic Zoom''. Participants were encouraged to conduct an open ended exploration of synthesis timbre using a combination of two different interfaces. The first was a standard interface with ten sliders, hypothesised to be suited to the ``convergent'' stage of creation. The second was a mapping of the entire 10-D combinatorial space to a 2-D surface using a space filling curve. This novel interface was intended to support the ``divergent'' aspect of creativity. The paths of around 250 users through both 2-D and 10-D space were logged and analysed. Both the interaction data and questionnaire results show that the different interfaces tended to be used for different aspects of sound creation, and a combination of these two navigation styles was deemed to be more useful than either individually. The study indicates that the predictable, separate parameters found in most music technology are more appropriate for convergent tasks.},

The board `conducted' various electronic sound sources played by Cross, Gordon Mumma, David Tudor, and David Behrman, using photoresistors fitted under the squares [1]. Reunion2012, on the other hand, utilises magnet sensors via an Arduino. Like in Cage's Variations V, this resulted in a musical situation where the improvising musicians had full control over their own sound, but no control regarding when their sound may be heard. In addition to a concert version, this paper also describes an interactive installation based on the same hardware.},

Technical barriers still persist that limit this activity to exclusive groups capable of learning skillsets far removed from one's musical craft. These skills include programming, soldering, microprocessors, wireless protocols, and circuit design. Those of us whose creative activity is centered in NIME have to become polyglots of many disciplines to achieve our work. In the NIME community, it's unclear that we should even draw distinctions between 'artist' and 'technician', because these skillsets have become integral to our creative practice. However, what about the vast communities of musicians, composers, and artists who want to leverage sensing to take their craft into new territory with no background in circuits, soldering, embedded programming, and sensor function? eMersion, a plug-and-play, modular, wireless alternative solution for creating NIMEs will be presented. It enables one to bypass the technical hurdles listed above in favor of immediate experimentation with musical practice and wireless sensing. A unique software architecture will also be unveiled that enables one to quickly and intuitively process and map unpredictable numbers and types of wireless data streams, the Digital Data Workstation.},

In both these parts an explicit consideration of the type of movement we would like the device to engender in performance drove the design choices. By considering these two parts separately we draw attention to two different levels at which movement might be considered in the design of DMIs; at a general level of ranges of movement in the creation of the controller and a more specific, but still quite open, level in the creation of the final instrument and a particular performance. In light of the results of this process the limitations of existing representations of movement within the DMI design discourse is discussed.

  Abstract                 = {Co-located tabletop tangible user interfaces (TUIs) for music performance are known for promoting multi-player collaboration with a shared interface, yet it is still unclear how to best support the awareness of the workspace in terms of understanding individual actions and the other group members actions, in parallel. In this paper, we investigate the effects of providing auditory feedback using ambisonics spatialisation, aimed at informing users about the location of the tangibles on the tabletop surface, with groups of mixed musical backgrounds. Participants were asked to improvise music on {SoundXY4: The Art of Noise}, a tabletop system that includes sound samples inspired by Russolo's taxonomy of noises. We compared spatialisation vs. no-spatialisation conditions, and findings suggest that, when using spatialisation, there was a clearer workspace awareness, and a greater engagement in the musical activity as an immersive experience.},

Based on a view of music pedagogy that emphasizes expressive, full-body communication early in the learning process, Andante promotes an understanding of the music rooted in the body, taking advantage of walking as one of the most fundamental human rhythms. We describe three example visualizations on a preliminary prototype as well as applications extending our examples for practice feedback, improvisation and composition. Through our project, we reflect on some high level considerations for the NIME community.},

  Abstract                 = {When performing a piece, a pianist's interpretation is communicated both through the sound produced and through body gestures. We present PiaF (Piano Follower), a prototype for augmenting piano performance by measuring gesture variations. We survey other augmented piano projects, several of which focus on gestural recognition, and present our prototype which uses machine learning techniques for gesture classification and estimation of gesture variations in real-time. Our implementation uses the Kinect depth sensor to track body motion in space, which is used as input data. During an initial learning phase, the system is taught a set of reference gestures, or templates. During performance, the live gesture is classified in real-time, and variations with respect to the recognized template are computed. These values can then be mapped to audio processing parameters, to control digital effects which are applied to the acoustic output of the piano in real-time. We discuss initial tests using PiaF with a pianist, as well as potential applications beyond live performance, including pedagogy and embodiment of recorded performance.},

Ten musicians of varying background were given a deliberately constrained musical instrument, a wooden cube containing a touch/force sensor, speaker and embedded computer. Each cube was identical in construction, but half the instruments were configured for two degrees of freedom while the other half allowed only a single degree. Each musician practiced at home and presented two performances, in which their techniques and reactions were assessed through video, sensor data logs, questionnaires and interviews. Results show that the addition of a second degree of freedom had the counterintuitive effect of reducing the exploration of the instrument's affordances; this suggested the presence of a dominant constraint in one of the two configurations which strongly differentiated the process of appropriation across the two groups of participants.},
